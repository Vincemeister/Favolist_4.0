“An incredible story of mental, emotional, and physical endurance.”—Michael Greger, MD, FACLM, New York Times bestselling author of How Not to Die
 
On the night before he was to turn forty, Rich Roll experienced a chilling glimpse of his future. Nearly fifty pounds overweight and unable to climb the stairs without stopping, he could see where his current sedentary life was taking him—and he woke up.

Plunging into a new routine that prioritized a plant-based lifestyle and daily training, Rich morphed—in a matter of mere months—from out of shape, mid-life couch potato to endurance machine. Finding Ultra recounts Rich’s remarkable journey to the starting line of the elite Ultraman competition, which pits the world’s fittest humans in a 320-mile ordeal of swimming, biking, and running. And following that test, Rich conquered an even greater one: the EPIC5—five Ironman-distance triathlons, each on a different Hawaiian island, all completed in less than a week.

One of Men’s Fitness Magazine’s “25 Fittest Men in the World,” Rich has become one of the most recognized advocates of plant-based living. In this newly revised and updated edition, he shares the practices, tools, and techniques he uses for optimal performance, longevity, and wellness, including diet and nutrition protocols.

Later in life he achieved great distinction as one of a small circle of court physicians to the family of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, at the very heart of Roman society. Susan Mattern's The Prince of Medicine offers the first authoritative biography in English of this brilliant, audacious, and profoundly influential figure.

Like many Greek intellectuals living in the high Roman Empire, Galen was a prodigious polymath, writing on subjects as varied as ethics and eczema, grammar and gout. Indeed, he was (as he claimed) as highly regarded in his lifetime for his philosophical works as for his medical treatises. However, it is for medicine that he is most remembered today, and from the later Roman Empire through the Renaissance, medical education was based largely on his works. Even up to the twentieth century, he remained the single most influential figure in Western medicine. Yet he was a complicated individual, full of breathtaking arrogance, shameless self-promotion, and lacerating wit. He was fiercely competitive, once disemboweling a live monkey and challenging the physicians in attendance to correctly replace its organs. Relentless in his pursuit of anything that would cure the patient, he insisted on rigorous observation and, sometimes, daring experimentation. Even confronting one of history's most
horrific events--a devastating outbreak of smallpox--he persevered, bearing patient witness to its predations, year after year.

The Prince of Medicine gives us Galen as he lived his life, in the city of Rome at its apex of power and decadence, among his friends, his rivals, and his patients. It offers a deeply human and long-overdue portrait of one of ancient history's most significant and engaging figures.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ta0PgRBbL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",,,Andrew Huberman: “The Secret Pulse of Time by Stefan Klein.

“Brilliant . . . riveting, scary, cogent, and cleverly argued.”—Beth Macy, author of Dopesick,
as heard on Fresh Air

This book is about pleasure. It’s also about pain. Most important, it’s about how to find the delicate balance between the two, and why now more than ever finding balance is essential. We’re living in a time of unprecedented access to high-reward, high-dopamine stimuli: drugs, food, news, gambling, shopping, gaming, texting, sexting, Facebooking, Instagramming, YouTubing, tweeting . . . The increased numbers, variety, and potency is staggering. The smartphone is the modern-day hypodermic needle, delivering digital dopamine 24/7 for a wired generation. As such we’ve all become vulnerable to compulsive overconsumption.
 
In Dopamine Nation, Dr. Anna Lembke, psychiatrist and author, explores the exciting new scientific discoveries that explain why the relentless pursuit of pleasure leads to pain . . . and what to do about it. Condensing complex neuroscience into easy-to-understand metaphors, Lembke illustrates how finding contentment and connectedness means keeping dopamine in check. The lived experiences of her patients are the gripping fabric of her narrative. Their riveting stories of suffering and redemption give us all hope for managing our consumption and transforming our lives. In essence, Dopamine Nation shows that the secret to finding balance is combining the science of desire with the wisdom of recovery.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ftSWt6nxL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",,,"Andrew Huberman: “If interested in the science underlying aggression, sex behavior, passivity and other states & emotions, this new book from Prof. David Anderson is superb: clear, modern, accessible, & rooted in data.

The 4-Hour Chef  isn’t just a cookbook. It’s a choose-your-own-adventure guide to the world of rapid learning. #1  New York Times  bestselling author (and lifelong non-cook) Tim Ferriss takes you from Manhattan to Okinawa, and from Silicon Valley to Calcutta, unearthing the secrets of the world’s fastest learners and greatest chefs. Ferriss uses cooking to explain “meta-learning,” a step-by-step process that can be used to master anything, whether searing steak or shooting 3-pointers in basketball. That is the real “recipe” of  The 4-Hour Chef. You'll train  inside  the kitchen for everything outside the kitchen. Featuring tips and tricks from chess prodigies, world-renowned chefs, pro athletes, master sommeliers, super models, and everyone in between, this “cookbook for people who don’t buy cookbooks” is a guide to mastering cooking and life. The 4-Hour Chef  is a five-stop journey through the art and science of learning: 1. META-LEARNING. Before you learn to cook, you must learn to learn. META charts the path to doubling your learning potential. 2. THE DOMESTIC. DOM is where you learn the building blocks of cooking. These are the ABCs (techniques) that can take you from Dr, Seuss to Shakespeare. 3. THE WILD. Becoming a master student requires self-sufficiency in all things. WILD teaches you to hunt, forage, and survive. 4. THE SCIENTIST. SCI is the mad scientist and modernist painter wrapped into one. This is where you rediscover whimsy and wonder. 5. THE PROFESSIONAL. Swaraj, a term usually associated with Mahatma Gandhi, can be translated as “self-rule.” In PRO, we’ll look at how the best in the world become the best in the world, and how you can chart your own path far beyond this book.

Modern orthodontics has persuaded us that braces and oral devices can correct these problems. While teeth can certainly be straightened, what about the underlying causes of this rapid shift in oral evolution and the health risks posed by obstructed airways? Sandra Kahn and Paul R. Ehrlich, a pioneering orthodontist and a world-renowned evolutionist, respectively, present the biological, dietary, and cultural changes that have driven us toward this major health challenge.

Why are we obsessed with the things we want only to be bored when we get them? 
Why is addiction perfectly logical to an addict? 
Why does love change so quickly from passion to indifference? 
Why are some people die-hard liberals and others hardcore conservatives? 
Why are we always hopeful for solutions even in the darkest times--and so good at figuring them out? 
The answer is found in a single chemical in your brain: dopamine. Dopamine ensured the survival of early man. Thousands of years later, it is the source of our most basic behaviors and cultural ideas--and progress itself. 
Dopamine is the chemical of desire that always asks for more--more stuff, more stimulation, and more surprises. In pursuit of these things, it is undeterred by emotion, fear, or morality. Dopamine is the source of our every urge, that little bit of biology that makes an ambitious business professional sacrifice everything in pursuit of success, or that drives a satisfied spouse to risk it all for the thrill of someone new. Simply put, it is why we seek and succeed; it is why we discover and prosper. Yet, at the same time, it's why we gamble and squander. 
From dopamine's point of view, it's not the having that matters. It's getting something--anything--that's new. From this understanding--the difference between possessing something versus anticipating it--we can understand in a revolutionary new way why we behave as we do in love, business, addiction, politics, religion--and we can even predict those behaviors in ourselves and others.

Lieberman, MD, and Georgetown University lecturer Michael E.

In this book, J. Allan Hobson offers a new understanding of altered states of consciousness based on knowledge of how our brain chemistry is balanced when we are awake and how that balance shifts when we fall asleep and dream. He draws on recent research that enables us to explain how psychedelic drugs work to disturb that balance and how similar imbalances may cause depression and schizophrenia. He also draws on work that expands our understanding of how certain drugs can correct imbalances and restore the brain's natural equilibrium. Hobson explains the chemical balance concept in terms of what we know about the regulation of normal states of consciousness over the course of the day by brain chemicals called neuromodulators. He presents striking confirmation of the principle that every drug that has transformative effects on consciousness interacts with the brain's own consciousness-altering chemicals. In the section called ""The Medical Drugstore,"" Hobson describes drugs used to counteract anxiety and insomnia, to raise and lower mood, and to eliminate or diminish the hallucinations and delusions of schizophrenia. He discusses the risks involved in their administration, including the possibility of new disorders caused by indiscriminate long-term use. In ""The Recreational Drugstore,"" Hobson discusses psychedelic drugs, narcotic analgesia, and natural drugs. He also considers the distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate drug use. In the concluding ""Psychological Drugstore,"" he discusses the mind as an agent, not just the mediator, of change, and corrects many erroneous assumptions and practices that hinder the progress of psychoanalysis.

Mitchell shows that love can endure, if only we become aware of our self-destructive efforts to protect ourselves from its risks.

Along with proper rest, it has been discovered that magnesium is critical in the activation of the nerve channels that allow for synaptic plasticity. This means that magnesium is fundamental to the processes of memory and learning. It is believed that magnesium threonate can enhance the brain’s receptors that are involved in these processes.

Magnesium threonate was developed by MIT researchers as an effective way for magnesium to cross the blood barrier. When magnesium is crossed with threonine, the researchers at MIT solved the issue of how to get magnesium from the blood to the brain successfully.

Vitamin K plays key roles in blood clotting, bone health and calcium transport.

There are two forms of vitamin K; K1 and K2. K1 is found naturally in plants, and has less bio-availability compared to K2, which is produced via bacteria fermentation, and found in fermented and animal products.

Huberman doesn’t mention the brand or dose of K2 he uses.

The adequate intake (AI) suggested by the NIH for vitamin K is 90 mcg for women and 120 mcg for men. Although they don’t state which form (K1 or K2).

There are two forms of vitamin K2, MK-4 and MK-7.

It is thought that MK-7 may have greater bio-availability than MK-4, and MK-7 can be converted into MK-4 in-vivo (in the body)28.

His nutrient-packed convenience solution is Athletic Greens. This drink comes as a powder in individual or bulk packages that can be mixed with 8 ounces of water for an individual serving. This gluten- and dairy-free supplemental drink provides 75 minerals, vitamins, and whole-food sourced nutrients without any added sugars, flavors, or unhealthy preservatives.

This beneficial beverage is a favorite of Dr. Huberman because it is an easy way to add in a healthy dose of nutrition without having to take the time to food prep or do more than shake or stir the powder in a glass.

He takes it at the same time as he takes Alpha GPC and says he’s impressed with it.


The benefits of Rhodiola Rosea include:

Reducing physical fatigue
Potentially enhancing memory and cognition

In Layne’s post on Instagram, he discusses dosage details, saying:

The Rhodiola extract should contain 3% rosavins and 1% salidroside.
It’s best to take on an empty stomach, but not close to bedtime, due to its slight stimulant effect.
In terms of dosage, amounts as low as 50 mg have been found to reduce fatigue, with 680 mg being the suggested upper limit, due to a bell-curve effect.
This info on dosages appears to come directly from Examine.com’s Rhodiola page, which Layne credits at the bottom of the Instagram post.

After taking the supplements, he could adequately test their effects on his system from his next blood test.

One company that Andrew endorses for blood tests that he has specifically endorsed on his podcast is Inside Tracker.

He takes it at the same time as he takes Alpha GPC and says he’s impressed with it.


The benefits of Rhodiola Rosea include:

Reducing physical fatigue
Potentially enhancing memory and cognition

In Layne’s post on Instagram, he discusses dosage details, saying:

The Rhodiola extract should contain 3% rosavins and 1% salidroside.
It’s best to take on an empty stomach, but not close to bedtime, due to its slight stimulant effect.
In terms of dosage, amounts as low as 50 mg have been found to reduce fatigue, with 680 mg being the suggested upper limit, due to a bell-curve effect.
This info on dosages appears to come directly from Examine.com’s Rhodiola page, which Layne credits at the bottom of the Instagram post.

Longevity Supplements,https://renuebyscience.com/product/pure-powder-100-grams/?rfsn=6440098.264698,PURE NMN Powder -100 Grams – RENUE BY SCIENCE – Bioavailable NAD+ Boosters,89.05,"NAD+ products have very poor bioavailability unless a delivery method is used that can protect the ingredient from digestion. When taken in regular capsules, less than 10% of NMN or NR make it to the bloodstream intact.

To address this problem, in 2016 we pioneered Sublingual delivery of NMN, and since then have advanced the industry further with Intranasal, Transdermal, and Liposomal NMN products.

Convenience/Portability - This is ideal for those who want the ability to take NMN with them throughout the day. Our sublingual tablets, LIPO capsules, and nasal spray are ideal for those who are on the go and who like to take NMN at different intervals throughout the day.

Fast Acting - If fast acting is important to you, then we recommend our sublingual powder, tablets, or nasal spray as they bypass digestion. They can provide rapid absorption and reach systemic circulation for a noticable effect in minutes. So whether it's before a quick workout or you need to quickly focus on mental tasks, these products can give you a quick boost when you need it most.

Long Lasting - LIPO NMN lasts longer in the body than our other NMN products. Liposomes protect the active ingredients from digestion and release slowly in the bloodstream up to 24 hours.

Fastest Cognitive Effect- The sublingual powder has a very fast effect on physical energy, but the intranasal spray has a much stronger impact on improved cognition (the relief of ""brain fog"").

Improved Energy- Sublingual delivery is much faster acting and the energy boost is more quickly noticed, but the most common report from users of all NAD+ boosters is increased energy.

Easiest to Take - Some people have trouble swallowing pills or applying powder under the tongue. For those people, LSG NMN is easier because it comes in an easy to apply liquid gel.

Best Bioavailability - Approximately 30% of NMN taken sublingually gets absorbed directly into the bloodstream, while the rest passes through the GI tract and gets broken down into less effective nicotinamide. However liposomal delivery avoids degradation in the GI tract entirely, meaning far more NMN is delivered to the tissues intact.

Best Cost per Milligram - The NMN product with the best price is our sublingual powder as there is very little added cost for processing. Tablets are next. Manufacturing of Liposomes takes the most time and expensive machinery, so cost the most per Milligram.

Best Overall Value - The best overall value is the product which is best in price combined with best bioavailability. Bioavailability is how much of the product actually makes it to the cells intact. For example, our LIPO capsules cost more per milligram to manufacture, but are 3 to 5 times more bioavailable than sublingual products, so are much more cost effective.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1693570260/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/suggested_products_images/renue_pure_ym3om2.png,,,"Does Andrew Huberman take NMN?” This is the question everyone has been asking, and Andrew has remained quiet about whether he was taking this “miracle” anti-aging supplement made famous by Dr. David Sinclair. Well, we finally have an answer.

In a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, Huberman reveals he takes 1 gram of Renue by Science NMN sublingually.

NMN, short for nicotinamide mononucleotide, is a molecule that our bodies make naturally, which converts to NAD+. NAD+ regulates DNA repair, energy metabolism, gene expression, and cellular stress responses. As it naturally decreases as we age, Dr. David Sinclair of Harvard recommends supplementing with 500-1000 grams of NMN daily.

As of March 2023, the FDA has been cracking down on the sale of NMN as a dietary supplement. Many companies like Amazon have been removing NMN from their shelves. Renue by Science is a pioneer in bringing NMN to the market and is still carrying it on its website. Huberman takes NMN sublingually – meaning under his tongue – every single morning.",one_time
