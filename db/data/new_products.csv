https://images.secretlab.co/theme/common/tr:n-w_150/magnus-pro-xl-sepcs.jpg","The sit-stand desk I'll be using at the heart of the setup. This is the standard size Magnus at 1.5 M long. One of the things I realized when unboxing all of this is how crazy good everything is packaged. Like you can see here, everything is organized and labeled to perfection, and that makes the building process a lot easier. Cuz you know, building a new desk setup is time-consuming and takes a lot of effort. Even the supply tool kit is aesthetic, and the tools itself are great quality. Things like this go a long way when buying an expensive desk. Something else I appreciate with this new setup is the integrated power supply in cables. The power outlet is uniquely integrated into the legs of the desk, which are just attached to the pre-built power supply underneath the desk. This is a big difference to the other sit-stand desks that I've built. There are pain when it comes to cable management and even with a lot of work, you can still see here that the cables running down my sit-stand desk to this day are all over the place. I personally cannot stand wires, and I'll show you the difference with the Magnus Pro when it's completely built. It's time to flip this desk over and put on some finishing touches. This is the cable management cover for the back end of the desk, and it will help make the mess of cables disappear later. Pulling the protective cover off, you can see how slim this desk is. And here is the sit-stand controls with preset button and a really useful locking button to prevent accidental height adjustments. Yeah, I've almost broke camera gear in the past bumping into the sit-stand desk control panel, so yeah, this is actually quite useful. So, what happens when you get a full metal desk like this and the Secret Lab accessories are all magnetic? Well, you get a chick magnet. Uh, okay, that's a pretty bad joke, but you do end up with the most convenient setup and accessories that can just be changed around by snapping stuff on and off. Even the perfectly sized desk mat is magnetized, so it snaps into place. It's really kind of satisfying.",,,one_time

https://images.secretlab.co/theme/common/2022-titan-evo-splash-main-min.png","Of course, I can't forget about the thing we all used to sit, a chair. This is the gaming chair. I'm sure most of you have heard of it; it's Secret Labs' Titan Evo chair. It uses a hybrid leatherette blend, and the stitching work is pretty incredible. This is my first time sitting on one, and it fits me like a glove, and it feels like I'm sitting on a rar-racing seat, but make it comfortable. Plus, there's a ton of adjustments available to fit exactly how I want it to: four-way lumbar support, plenty of side support, and a full-length backrest for your head too. It works well as both a gaming chair and for general work use. The coolest part, though, pull this lever here and boom, it becomes a life flat chair with an insane 165° of recline. You've got to make sure your butt and back are as comfortable as they can be, you know. So, I'm really happy with how this setup turned out, being able to carve out this small space and transform it into an area I can unwind and comfortably get some gaming hours in. Because we should all work hard, but also, of course, play hard. Using it at night has been a blast. It looks amazing with the smart lights and is just a great vibe while looking pretty minimal and modern. I think I appreciate the fact that this desk setup doubles as a productive editing station for the growing team, which is a big, big bonus. So, using the desk for weeks now, I'm still blown away by how practical the Magnus desk is. Cable management hasn't been easier than this, and the fact that I can just flip up the cable management cover and add in new devices without going under the desk is honestly underrated. A big, big thank you to Secret Lab for making this setup possible. ",,,one_time
