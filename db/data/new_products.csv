This is literally the Next Generation in sleep and health tracking and it's completely replaced my Apple Watch and Oura ring. The smart mattress cover monitors your body in sleep through its 4000 sense of points. The quad core CPU machine here tracks the changes and movements in real time to continually deliver the optimal temperature and environment in bed every minute of the night. One of the coolest parts is its Dual Zone setup, so my partner and I both have different temperature zones based on our own body temperature and it even can buzz you awake without waking up the other. Waking up to the most detailed sleep and health metrics on the EightSleep app has been a really insightful start to the day. There is seriously no better feeling than sliding into a bed that is perfectly cool on a hot summer night or perfectly warm during a chilly evening.

Over the last eight years, Jason Bacher and Brian Buirge of Good F*cking Design Advice (GFDA) have made a name for themselves in the international design community, inspiring creatives, artists, and entrepreneurs with their products, weekly e-mails, and most important, their unorthodox advice about work ethic and the creative process.

Do the F*cking Work is a collection of 100 beautifully packaged pieces that showcase their irreverent advice—inspiration that will help unstick even the most dedicated procrastinators. Covering everything from drinking your morning coffee to handling productive criticism, from embracing failure to rejecting the status quo, their insights upend conventional thinking and teach you to embrace and celebrate the journey of creation—the joy of trying, failing, learning, and sometimes failing again.

To make something good we have to make some mistakes. Bacher and Buirge teach you to embrace the unknown and to f*cking laugh at yourself during the process. There is a method to their madness—a surprising reassurance that is baked into their bluntness. We’re all trying, messing up, and trying again. And there’s joy to be found in that—something we often overlook in our rush to get everything done and get it right the first time.

With personal insights, actionable advice, stylish visuals, and lots of colorful language, Do the F*cking Work will leave you feeling renewed and inspired, and will make you see that the value of work is as much about the process as the outcome.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mQLTk1C0L._SL1500_.jpg

Rich Stapleton and Rosa Park, Cereal’s founders, travel extensively for the magazine and were inspired to create a series of city guides that highlight their favorite places to visit.

Meticulously researched and illustrated with original photography, this handsome travel guide includes:
Photo essays on striking images of the city
An illustrated neighborhood map
Interviews and essays from celebrated locals, such as chef Camille Becerra, shop owner Kai Avent-deLeon, and others
Lists of essential architectural points of interest, museums, galleries, day trips outside the city, and unique goods to buy
An itinerary for an ideal day in New York

The advertisements of this era expressed these go-go years, when rock and roll reigned supreme and man reached the moon. Just around the corner societal changes would spark a revolution. With the consumerist euphoria of the fifties still going strong and the race to the moon at its height, the mood of advertising in the sixties was cheerful, optimistic, and at times, revolutionary. The decade’s ads touted perceived progress—such as tang and instant omelets - ""just add water""—while striving to reinforce good old American values.    Stars like Sean Connery, Woody Allen, Salvador Dalí, and Sammy Davis Jr. endorsed everything from bourbon to handmade suits in an attempt by Madison Avenue to urge Americans to open their wallets and participate in one giant consumer binge. Social change at the end of the era brought psychedelic swirls and liberated women and minorities to a newly conscious public. Keep an eye out for some of the more surprising and controversial ads—such as Tupperware billing its storage container as a ""wifesaver."" From forgotten cars, to cigarettes to food and much more, this colorful collection of print ads explores the wide, wonderful world of 60s Americana.

It’s a nice balance between durability, spaciousness, and good looks. There are two sizes to pick from and I opted for the smaller size for its portability and I'm quite glad that I did because there's more than enough room for most trips up to three to four weeks in length. It also looks extremely premium, in part thanks to its timeless design and the black Italian leather detailing here. But it's also as practical and safe as it is stylish.

The first carry-on bag I have with me is also from Carl Friedrich and this one is their Polson weekend bag. I'll have this usually on the shoulder strap and I'll carry it with me after I've checked in at the airport. I picked this bag because it's an incredibly well-constructed bag made from vegetable-tanned leather by artisans in Florence, Italy, so you can be assured that you know it's really rugged and well built.

By no means though is this a budget-friendly bag but it's great if you're looking for a quality bag without all the overly branded stuff. It also makes for a great one-bag approach for weekend trips too.

The 26.1MP back-illuminated X-Trans sensor and X-Processor 4 imaging engine combine to deliver exceptional performance, with autofocusing down to -7EV in just 0.02 secs – and detail-packed results full of vibrant color. Pick up and start creating in seconds by flicking over to the Advanced SR Auto mode, or take more control over your output. X-T30 II has the features and functions to fit your creative style and mood, including the ability to share your work in seconds, via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
• Assured Image Quality X-T30 II uses Fujifilm’s fourth-generation X-Trans CMOS 4 back-illuminated sensor, designed to minimize noise, while also extending sensitivity to ISO 160. The unique structure of the X-Trans color filter array also minimizes moiré and false colors, without the need for an optical low pass filter – ensuring the best possible image quality, packed with detail and vibrant, true-to-life color.

• Incredible Focusing in All Conditions Never miss a moment, thanks to the X-Processor 4 quad-core CPU inside X-T30 II. It offers fast, accurate autofocusing in as little as 0.02 secs on any subject, but significant enhancements have been made to the original X-T30’s ability to track moving subjects, optimizing autofocus for both stills and its powerful 4K/30p video capabilities. Low light focusing performance has also been expanded from the original X-T30 model, down to -7EV (with XF50mmF1.0 R WR attached) for even greater versatility.

• Advanced Video and Imaging Controls A truly versatile imaging device, X-T30 II offers the ability to record 4K video at 30 frames-per- second, or 240fps at 1080p, to create 10x super slow-motion effects. Filmmakers needing extreme color fidelity can record 10-bit, 4:2:2 color through the camera’s HDMI port, F-Log internally, or video using any one of X-T30 II’s 18 Film Simulation modes. Alongside these, X-T30 II makes it easy to define your own distinctive visual style on still images – offering in-camera control over film grain texture, color depth, clarity, sharpness, and highlight and shadow tones.

• In Touch With Your Creativity From the dial-based operation, and compact, lightweight body, to the latest-generation Fujifilm APS-C sensor, X-T30 II lights up the imagination and inspires creativity – fusing cutting edge, convenient features with a vintage aesthetic charm. The three-inch, two-way tilting screen, for example, offers impressive touchscreen functionality, making it easy to get high-quality results in challenging conditions. For those who want to focus purely on light and composition, the Advanced SR Auto mode – easily activated with a lever on the camera’s top plate – automatically chooses the optimum settings from 58 presets.

• Made for Sharing X-T30 II is primed for sharing. Use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to share your memories with friends and family on social media, by connecting and downloading images to the FUJIFILM Camera Remote App – or instantly connect and print your favorites from any compatible FUJIFILM INSTAX Smartphone printer.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SnHemmp-L._AC_SL1500_.jpg

https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71E+feofkML._AC_SL1500_.jpg","This is a Nexo 65 watt fast charger from uGreen, and it's much more convenient carrying this charger than most laptop charging bricks. It's half the size of a MacBook charger and it's multi-port too, so it has two USB-C and one USB-A input, so I can charge my laptop, phone, and an accessory all at the same time. Another difference is the fact that it's a gallium nitrate charger so, in case you don't know what that is (sometimes you'll see it referenced as GaN or GaN), it charges a lot more efficiently than standard silicon-based chargers, along with it dissipating heat more effectively. So, they're a worthwhile purchase and they're not that expensive in the first place anyway. Just a heads up though, to get the full 65-watt fast charging speed, this charger needs to be connected to a single port. So, if I'm in a hurry and I need to charge my MacBook to about 50% from zero, I'll use this as a dedicated charger to get that half charge in only about 30 minutes - a lifesaver when I forget to charge my device the night before in the hotel and I need to run out the door in the morning. Size is everything when you travel, so yeah, just love flicking close the charger into a small cube and then throwing it into the bag. It's definitely a small but mighty charger.

A new 23mmF2 fixed lens perfectly complements the cutting-edge 26.1MP X-Trans CMOS 4 back-side illuminated sensor at its heart. The X100V also features the powerful X-Processor 4 quad-core imaging engine, which drives superfast, precision autofocus right down to -5EV, while an Advanced Hybrid Viewfinder ensures photographers are always ready for the perfect moment. With the addition of a tilting LCD touchscreen, optional weather sealing (with separately purchased lens) and a great design, you have the perfect recipe for beautiful still images and spectacular 4K video, whatever the situation.
• Great photography every day, everywhere: X100V features a newly designed, incorporated 23 millimeter F2 lens, ensuring you preserve those special moments at maximum resolution with minimal distortion. It also offers an improved close focusing performance compared to previous X100 models, and, for the first time in the X100 line, you can keep making images even in the toughest conditions when you attach the optional adapter ring with the weather-sealing protection lens (sold separately). This outstanding lens retains the same slim line design as other X100 models, so it retains compatibility with existing WCL and TCL lens attachments.

• Designed for quality and speed: From fleeting holiday moments and family celebrations to hard-hitting visual stories and ever-changing city streets, X100V has been designed to always deliver exceptional image and video quality. Creating a tool this capable takes powerful technology; That’s why Fujifilm’s state-of-the-art X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor and X-processor 4 combination sits at this camera’s core. Pairing this exceptional, 26.1MP, back-side illuminated sensor and powerful quad-core CPU results in incredible quality, wide dynamic range, lightning-fast processing and precision AF performance, right down to -5EV.

• Two ways to see an Image: To truly convey the magic of a scene, you need to be immersed in the moment and X100V’s advanced hybrid viewfinder gives you everything you need to do exactly that. At the flick of a switch, you can change between the X100V’s 0.52x magnification optical viewfinder (OVF), which uses parallax-correcting frame lines to let you see outside the shot, and it’s 3.69M-dot OLED electronic viewfinder (EVF), which gives you a real-time preview of your exposure. You can even get the best of both worlds by using the electric rangefinder function (ERF) to activate a mini EVF display within the OVF window.

• Frame the perfect image: X100V has been specifically tailored for photographers who are never without a camera by their side and always ready to frame a moment. The two-way, tilting LCD touchscreen is a perfect example of Fujifilm’s tailored design. This new technology within the X100V offers quick, intuitive controls and makes struggling to frame images from difficult angles a thing of the past. Furthermore, when folded flat it fits seamlessly into the camera’s slim line body, and in doing so, this sophisticated LCD touchscreen finds the perfect balance between functionality and portability.

• Movies on the move: The X100V allows you to explore a whole new world of image making with the ability to create stunning 4K video at 30 frames per second. Additionally, super slow-motion footage can be recorded using the camera’s full HD/120p setting, so you can relive details that would otherwise be missed by the naked eye. This professional-level quality is backed up by Fujifilm’s outstanding color reproduction technology and unique selection of in-camera film simulation modes, while those who need more fidelity can record 10-bit, 4:2:2 color via the HDMI port.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91gNat-ImwL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

And if you're a subscriber, you'll know that I absolutely love this camera. This is the best camera I've used yet. It's so good because it's stylish, it's well-built, it's portable, the fixed lens is amazing, and of course, Fuji's color science and film simulations are to die for. If you don't know what Fujifilm Sims are, I'll fill you in real quick. They replicate the charming look of film without the hassle and high cost of actually using film. So, you can get these really gorgeous shots right out of the camera as JPEGs you can share immediately without the need to edit big raw files. It's a big time saver, so I can put that time instead into enjoying the new city that I'm exploring.

The only time I'd consider replacing this camera is if I ever end up with a Leica, but they cost an arm and a leg, unlike this Fuji X100V. ",,

This nifty watch is powered by Tudor's impressive in-house MT5402 COSC certified movement, which has 70 hours of power reserve and is waterproof to 660 feet or 200 meters. This is a luxury watch that I don't baby. I track, swim, dive, and run with it, and it still looks great.

I find that wearing a nice watch when traveling is a way to elevate a simple outfit, whether I'm at a nice dinner, sitting in business class, or just sightseeing. I don't actually take my Apple Watch with me, but my Oura ring is responsible for all my health metric tracking when I'm abroad, so I can still enjoy wearing my Black Bay 58.

This journey began in 1945. Otto Johannes Müller founds the business having returned from the war. He makes the first shaving brushes and designs the MÜHLE signet. Hans-Jürgen Müller takes over the company, which has grown to 40 employees. MÜHLE is exporting its products to 36 countries. Under pressure from the German Democratic Republic, Hans-Jürgen Müller sells the company and MÜHLE becomes a state-owned enterprise. Now rebranded, the business manufactures brushes only for the state. Hans-Jürgen Müller becomes a self-employed brush maker. A new Europe evolves, Hans-Jürgen Müller regains the family business and trades as Hans-Jürgen Müller KG, the MÜHLE signet remains. MÜHLE struggles to survive after reunification. However, little by little, the company wins new customers and rehires former employees. Dawn of a new Millenia. The offering is expanded to a full range of wet shaving goods. The MÜHLE brand comes to the fore.
• THE HANDLE: We design all of our products to be long-lasting, and this handle is no exception. The modern handle options include classic chrome, rose-gold metal, faux tortoiseshell, and black chrome.

• CLOSED COMB RAZOR: Grooming has never felt more nostalgic. This classic safety razor head has a closed tooth comb design that, paired with a gap behind the foam edge, prevents build-up. The blade angle is a special design for the closest shave.

• RECOMMENDED TECHNIQUE: For the cleanest shave, it is always recommended to keep the skin pulled taut and the blade should be drawn across the skin without applying any pressure at all. Shaving with the grain will have the best results.

• MÜHLE DIFFERENCE: Our actions are driven by an affinity with nature and a desire for the very highest quality. Expert know-how and pioneering spirit flow into every product, whether it be a handcrafted unique item or serially produced goods.

• SUSTAINABILITY: As a member of the Environmental Alliance of Saxony we are committed to sustainability and cooperate with suppliers who uphold the same high standards.

The main card that I now use is Citi’s Prestige card, and this thing has so many travel perks. With this card, I get access to over 1,200 airport lounges around the world, the fourth night stay at a hotel is paid for free, travel insurance, luxury travel service, mobile phone cover, and a concierge service, all with this card. It’s pretty crazy. There is an annual fee of almost a thousand dollars, but the perks paid for itself. And plus, every dollar that I spend is points collected on this card, so then I can, for example, upgrade to business class or even first class with these points, which is what I did for this trip, thanks to my personal spending habits.

And this is why I also really love my laptop, because all of these services are usually managed through the credit card’s app or their online portal, so I can just quickly login, I can check my point balance, book all my flights and accommodations through this credit card and get all of these benefits, and, of course, this is all facilitated by the card. So, that is how I manage to travel so much with a business class experience and even pay for flights and accommodations too.",,

This isn't a digital camera, it's actually an old school film camera but hear me out because it's something you want to at least know more about. For starters, this bad boy is only $50 brand new and it shoots beautiful film photos without costing an arm and a leg and the burden of trying to find second-hand film cameras. Just take a look at these shots that I've developed over the last month. They have an incredibly nostalgic look and filter to them that you just don't get with modern cameras nowadays, with its aesthetic grain, lens blur, and sepia tones – all things that you do not want in a modern digital camera but it looks beautifully imperfect on film. It's also a half frame camera meaning you get 72 exposures on a single film roll rather than the typical 36 exposures that you usually find, which means more bang for buck. The camera itself looks super retro and visually appealing to use, although it's a little too light for my liking. And film photography is back on the rise in an era of embracing the imperfect, and the Actar H35 is perfect for capturing Kodak moments as they call it.",,

Pop in a couple double-A batteries and they light up like a lifelike 8-bit character. I’ve had these for years now and the batteries are still running strong. At $20, grabbing a few to display on a shelf is a great fun way to show off your personality and brighten up the space. It doesn’t seem like their main website is up and running anymore, which is weird, but there are still a ton of them available on Amazon which I’ll place a link to in the description box for you guys.",,

I’ve used a few over the years and the first one I ever got was the affordable Samsung T5 SSD. You can get these or the T7 in a one-terabyte size for only about $80 these days on Amazon too. These tiny SSD drives transfer files up to 10 times faster than external hard drives with read/write speeds of up to 1000 megabytes per second. Although I don’t get close to these speeds on my old T5 here, it’s also shock resistant with drops from six foot. I’ve thrown this one around for years and haven’t had a single issue with it yet. This is a great budget SSD to get started and is fast enough to improve your workflow and get work done that much faster with its fast read and write speeds, particularly if you’re transferring big files or do video editing, for example.",,

It’s a relatively small pen with nice heft to it at 25 grams and is machined with an aluminum body with a cerakote finishing and a matte finishing as well. The custom click mechanism plated in copper is extremely satisfying to click too. At $90, it’s by no means a budget pen, but if you plan to use it for many years to come, considering it’s built to last a lifetime, divide that cost across years and it technically is an affordable purchase, rather than you know, buying and replacing a ton of cheap ballpoint pens",,

","This one is in solid Maple to replace the darker Walnut shelf I currently have because this new space gets a load of sunlight throughout the day so the interior theme is light mode, off-whites, natural leather, and Maple Woods and a touch of black for contrast so this shelf is the perfect fit and I think Walnut should better suit darker tone setups. This is made of Eastern Hard Rock Maple and cork legs for that beautiful textured finish and then 5052 aluminum shelf all of which are hand finish. The result is an immediately elevated high-end look to the empty space. This thing holds up to 50 pounds but I usually have my monitor mounted above anyway and before I start filling out the Shelf let's move on to the next item but I think it's already looking quite nice.

It's less outdoorsy and more modern, portable, and sleek. It's nicely rounded and has modern red accents. This design I really like; it looks more at home in a modern setup than the BenQ gs50, but hey, you might prefer the green and orange colorway on the gs50.

So, the capsule 3 is rated at 300 lumens compared to BenQ's 500 lumens but surprisingly the capsule 3 seemed a lot brighter in my tests that I ran. It was definitely not only brighter but sharper and has higher contrast output too. Overall, the laser tech in the capsule 3 just looked a whole lot more contrasty, color reproduction was more accurate based on the coupled color tests that I ran, and blacks were just a whole lot darker, which I sort of mentioned for laser projectors, and that's quite important because it's a known trend that TV shows and movies are becoming darker in their color tones that they use.

Both of these projectors were super convenient; I was able to place this just about anywhere, and the Keystone correction on both these projectors will automatically focus on just about any surface. But the nebula capsule 3 seemed to focus that much faster and more accurately. Plus, the keystoning and the rotation of the screen was pretty easy to manage. It's been such a blast taking these two around any room and even the rooftop for a movie night without cables needed.

There’s a lot of good stuff to go over here, these two projectors are both seriously amazing, and these are the ones you want to get if you’re looking to set up an at-home cinematic experience while still getting that portability if you want to take it around to different rooms or even outside.

Based on specs alone, the nebula Cosmos laser 4K is $300 dearer at $2199 and is a full 10 pounds heavier than the Xgimi, but we do get a brighter rating and arguably better speakers. I’ll do a sound comparison test for you in a moment. It is worth mentioning that both projectors achieve 4K not natively but through pixel shifting, and don’t worry though, it’s tough to even see the difference between native 4K and pixel shift at 4K for the most part.

Setting these up immediately, I saw a huge difference in picture quality between the gs50 and the capsule 3. The 4K HDR 10 supported resolution of both the LED Xgimi and Laser Cosmos is super crispy, and the content looks like it’s printed onto the walls even at huge sizes. And speaking of sizes, the nebula Cosmos 4K runs up to a huge 150 inch in screen size, and Xgimi runs up to an absolute gigantic 300 inches, which I don’t even have space for. But heads up that Xgimi recommends a maximum of 200 inches before picture quality suffers.

In my studio space and with most at-home Cinema setups, the 120 to 200-inch screen size is more than enough for a super immersive theater experience that should take up most of a wall or installed projector screen. Anything more, and I find that the picture quality suffers even at 4K. Though with consumer priced 8K laser projectors being announced, this may all change soon. Either way, 4K is going to be more than enough for most people.",cosmoslaser,discount code: cosmoslaser

They're both 1080p full HD projectors, have a similar throw distance of 120 by 1. Both come with speakers and Android TV installed for easy access to a ton of popular apps, movies, and shows. They're also both similarly priced at the $800 range. The main differences are in its physical design and its laser and led differences, which are pretty significant.

Let's talk about benq's projector first, the gs50, and its styling because I think it really has a stylish design that resembles more a camping item than an LED projector. Its design includes green rubberized panels, orange accents, and a faux leather handle, which, by the way, is just rubble but it's pretty decent looking overall. As outdoorsy as it may look, though, it's only Splash proof, so if it's raining outside you want to run back inside with it. It does come with a zippered nylon case for easy travel though. The actual build quality feels a bit 'yeah' with its plasticky rubbery feel.

It projects up to 100 inches in screen size, which is definitely big enough for any outdoor or portable use. But because it's only rated 500 lumens in brightness, going up to the max 100-inch size, you'll lose contrast and brightness. Bringing it back down to about 60 to 80 inches seemed like a happy medium between size and contrast for this particular LED projector.",,

https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61h1ok8MhkL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","First up on this list is the surprisingly affordable gaming monitor, Gigabyte's M32UC. And I say surprisingly because, in my mind, it's worth more than its price tag, and here is why. It’s a curved 32-inch 4K monitor that is specifically designed to cater to both console and PC gamers. There are two specs you can’t skimp on when it comes to gaming: refresh rate and response time, and this monitor absolutely delivers. It features a one-millisecond response time and a 144Hz refresh rate right out of the box. And get this, you’ll be able to overclock the panel via DisplayPort 1.4 to 160Hz refresh rate, which is incredible and probably overkill for most people, but it is there if you have the PC system to support a 160Hz refresh rate.

The monitor also has an HDMI 2.1 port, cranking out 4K at 120Hz for console gamers. While the in-built KVM switch lets me instantly switch back and forth between keyboard, mouse, and joystick controller, there's even a USB-C port which can also upstream and deliver power up to 18 watts. At the modest 32-inch size, pixel density is really high, and it’s also well-lit, which is perfect for my darker desk setup in this particular room. It’s been a stunning panel to experience high-end games on, like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Metro Exodus, with great color reproduction, brightness, and performance. You can almost definitely feel the rapid response time and smoothness in faster-paced games like Counter-Strike GO. I think a game like this suits a 32-inch screen far better than it did with my 38-inch ultrawide.

It was pretty tough to fault this monitor other than the subpar speakers and stand. But considering you can now find this monitor for $600 brand new, I’ll leave a link to it below – this is the budget 4K gaming monitor to beat this year. Make sure you add it into your gaming setup.",,

A new 23mmF2 fixed lens perfectly complements the cutting-edge 26.1MP X-Trans CMOS 4 back-side illuminated sensor at its heart. The X100V also features the powerful X-Processor 4 quad-core imaging engine, which drives superfast, precision autofocus right down to -5EV, while an Advanced Hybrid Viewfinder ensures photographers are always ready for the perfect moment. With the addition of a tilting LCD touchscreen, optional weather sealing (with separately purchased lens) and a great design, you have the perfect recipe for beautiful still images and spectacular 4K video, whatever the situation.
• Great photography every day, everywhere: X100V features a newly designed, incorporated 23 millimeter F2 lens, ensuring you preserve those special moments at maximum resolution with minimal distortion. It also offers an improved close focusing performance compared to previous X100 models, and, for the first time in the X100 line, you can keep making images even in the toughest conditions when you attach the optional adapter ring with the weather-sealing protection lens (sold separately). This outstanding lens retains the same slim line design as other X100 models, so it retains compatibility with existing WCL and TCL lens attachments.

• Designed for quality and speed: From fleeting holiday moments and family celebrations to hard-hitting visual stories and ever-changing city streets, X100V has been designed to always deliver exceptional image and video quality. Creating a tool this capable takes powerful technology; That’s why Fujifilm’s state-of-the-art X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor and X-processor 4 combination sits at this camera’s core. Pairing this exceptional, 26.1MP, back-side illuminated sensor and powerful quad-core CPU results in incredible quality, wide dynamic range, lightning-fast processing and precision AF performance, right down to -5EV.

• Two ways to see an Image: To truly convey the magic of a scene, you need to be immersed in the moment and X100V’s advanced hybrid viewfinder gives you everything you need to do exactly that. At the flick of a switch, you can change between the X100V’s 0.52x magnification optical viewfinder (OVF), which uses parallax-correcting frame lines to let you see outside the shot, and it’s 3.69M-dot OLED electronic viewfinder (EVF), which gives you a real-time preview of your exposure. You can even get the best of both worlds by using the electric rangefinder function (ERF) to activate a mini EVF display within the OVF window.

• Frame the perfect image: X100V has been specifically tailored for photographers who are never without a camera by their side and always ready to frame a moment. The two-way, tilting LCD touchscreen is a perfect example of Fujifilm’s tailored design. This new technology within the X100V offers quick, intuitive controls and makes struggling to frame images from difficult angles a thing of the past. Furthermore, when folded flat it fits seamlessly into the camera’s slim line body, and in doing so, this sophisticated LCD touchscreen finds the perfect balance between functionality and portability.

• Movies on the move: The X100V allows you to explore a whole new world of image making with the ability to create stunning 4K video at 30 frames per second. Additionally, super slow-motion footage can be recorded using the camera’s full HD/120p setting, so you can relive details that would otherwise be missed by the naked eye. This professional-level quality is backed up by Fujifilm’s outstanding color reproduction technology and unique selection of in-camera film simulation modes, while those who need more fidelity can record 10-bit, 4:2:2 color via the HDMI port.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91gNat-ImwL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

If you’re looking to buy a new camera or upgrade from your phone's camera, this is the camera to take a look at. I have not stopped using it since I got it at the start of the year. Heck, I even created a new Instagram account dedicated to this camera, even though Instagram isn’t a picture sharing platform anymore, rest in peace.

The X100V features an insanely crispy new fixed 23-millimeter F2.0 lens, equivalent to 35 millimeters full frame. But other than that, what makes Fuji’s mirrorless cameras so special is Fuji's digital film simulations. They give you access to a load of analog film-inspired looks applied directly to your photo, so I get these amazing-looking photos right out of the camera with zero time wasted on editing. Just check out some of these shots here I took earlier in the year during a getaway in Australia with my dog Arlo, then abroad in Thailand, which was a great backdrop for a custom film simulation I created with a lot of film grain and lens flare for a nostalgic look, and then more recently when I traveled around Malaysia. These photos I added a Zen and Bloom lens onto the camera for a natural bloom effect.

Build quality is also terrific for the price – it punches above its weight with its tactile buttons throughout, and it’s just an absolute pleasure to use, not to mention an absolute good looker to boot. Recently, the camera has gone viral on social media and gained a cult following for its film simulations. It’s now my favorite camera of not just 2022, but of all time. I know that’s a pretty big claim, but it’s just that good. I’m really hoping to compare it to the Leica Q2 or even Q3 if it’s launched next year.",,

They’re not just more affordable than the Philips Hue lights I was using, they’re just as bright, if not brighter in lumens than Philips Hue. So it was a no-brainer change to me.

The standout Govee smart light to me this year was hands down Govee’s T2 Envisual lights, the world’s very first dual-color camera-matching TV backlights, and a big improvement from the previous generation T1 lights. They're unique in that they use Govee’s dual cameras Envisual tech to scan the TV’s content in real-time on screen to match the colors it sees, and projects them via its light strip behind the TV, which features 60 rgbic light beads per meter, which is why the light strip is so bright.

The T2 Envisual lights have just added so much depth to my screen while gaming, watching movies, and even more recently, watching the World Cup with friends. It’s not just wowed me but visitors too. The camera does surprisingly well to keep up with all the action on the screen when it comes to the World Cup, and even fast-paced gaming. It’s just a treat to use.

Govee is a rapidly growing company, and definitely one to watch out for in 2023, in my opinion. They’ve cemented themselves as a feature-packed smart light for just a fraction of the cost of competitors, and I’m pretty excited to see what they do next year.

https://theomnidesk.com.au/cdn/shop/products/8.webp?v=1679550063","Okay, moving on to my new desk setup. I’ve moved into a dedicated office space this year and at the heart of it all is of course my new sit-stand desk that I’ve been absolutely loving. I chose Omnidesk’s new Ascent range of sit-stand desks, with this one here being the XL version made from solid, heavier wood, and redesigned white table legs that are motorized and more silent than ever. I’ve always been a fan of sit-stand desks in helping alleviate joint attention since I work pretty long hours at the desk most days. And then when you pair it with a good chair, this one here is the Herman Miller Aeron, something else that I absolutely loved and was a great purchase this year – I don’t know if I should include it into this list though because it’s not necessarily tech. But anyway, great chair. When you pair it with a great chair, you’ve got an ergonomic setup that your body will thank you for, for years to come.",,

I’ve used the previous generation TS3 Plus for years now, and the new TS4 blows it out of the water. When I plug the laptop into the dock, I’ve essentially got an insane 18 ports of additional connectivity. And that is a lot of different options and ports to use. To give you an idea, this dock has 8K display support, 98-watt charging, DisplayPort 1.4, and even a microSD card slot, which has actually come in handy. This dock has almost every port required in a single package, and there’s good reason why it’s known as the king of Thunderbolt docks. It was sold out in the first few waves of shipment. It was actually pretty hard to get my hands on this dock. And just be prepared as well for the price tag of $380. Yeah, it’s not cheap, but it’s been a worthy investment.",,

","Another desk accessory I was really quite impressed with is Razer’s new flagship keyboard, the DeathStalker V2 Pro. I’ve always wanted a minimal keyboard that can be both perfect for work and gaming, and this keyboard delivers. The performance of this keyboard is second to none, with a polling rate of 998Hz, Bluetooth 5.0, and Adaptive Frequency. The zero input lag with this keyboard, and I mean there is – it feels like it’s wired sometimes – so it’s been really nice just using the one keyboard day and night for typing and for gaming. The pitfalls, in my opinion, are its red linear switches, which are a little too soft for my liking, and then the price tag of $250. It’s by no means a cheap keyboard but, hey, if you’re in the market for a high-end keyboard that’ll cover both your work and gaming needs equally, give this one a go. I’ve been using it since launch and it’s been great ever since.",,

https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619WvWbqb0L._AC_SL1500_.jpg","Sonos has really impressed me this year. I’ve set up my entire new creative studio with Sonos speakers and I have zero regrets. They sound amazing, they work together seamlessly, and they look so good in the studio. But there has been one particular speaker that has been especially impressive – Sonos’s new Ray soundbar that launched mid-year and it’s a steal at $279, if you ask me. At 22 inches and just a little over four pounds, the Ray is smaller than the 25-inch Beam sibling and half the size of the flagship Sonos Arc. It may be small but it still gets two angled tweeters, mid-woofers, and four Class-D drivers, and it equates to some pretty good bang for buck sound.

The Ray has a diverse yet well-balanced sound stage and well-articulated bass, which is especially impressive considering its smaller size and smaller price tag too. A big downside though, which has to be pointed out, is the lack of Dolby Atmos or HDMI eARC support. But it can be forgiven for its budget price tag. I think what the Ray has done this year is it basically offers a killer gateway product that may well get you hooked into the Sonos ecosystem. Otherwise, if you have the extra cash, the Beam is a worthy alternative that you might want to consider.",,

And with the quad-core CPU machine here, then it optimizes the different zones of the bed, so it’s the perfect temperature throughout the night.

And the ability to crop into any segment of the video in post through Insta360’s robust software has me frothing over this camera this year. A heads-up if you’re completely new to 360 footage: there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to editing this type of footage, and the videos must be processed before editing which is a little time-consuming.

It’s a very small mouse, weighing in at little over 2 ounces or 60 grams without the battery, and then it runs for 950 hours over a Bluetooth connection. It has a fast and responsive 18,000 DPI sensor and is really tactile and has sharp clicks. It’s been surprisingly awesome to use when gaming, from Metro Exodus to Counter-Strike GO. There’s not much to dislike about this mouse at only $70, but it’s been great to use.",,

Walking down the street with these in, it feels like a personal jam session with your favorite artist. The directionality of its audio is superb, and pair it up with the fact that they’re just 5 grams each – you forget that they’re even there, unlike over-the-ear headphones.

It’s a tech gadget that was announced at CES this year, and you want this video bar for your desk and work from home setup because it does a whole lot more than just show up for video calls. There are four things in one here with this video bar – it’s a 2K high quality camera for one, a speaker, a microphone, and a face light too. The camera is surprisingly crisp at 2K resolution, which really is more than enough for any type of video call. It looks a whole heap better than practically any integrated laptop webcam and features instant auto focus and Solo Frame, which keeps you in focus and centered even when you move around. You can direct audio straight to the B600 video bar too, thanks to the robust dual speakers that work great for voices and video calls. And if dual speakers aren’t enough, we also get a 4 microphone array in this video bar, which is pretty solid considering you’ll find a 3 microphone array in current MacBook Pros. These microphones help cancel out background sound and, more importantly, produce audible and clearer voice, so you know we’re actually heard in those pesky all-hand meetings where everyone talks over one another. Also, the inbuilt lights that AnkerWork of course magic sight adaptive lighting isn’t gimmicky, actually. It’s genuinely useful for video. A tap on the right side of the B600 turns the light on and off, and the brightness intensity can be adjusted by dialing the meter next to the lens, along with lighting temperature too. It neatly doubles as a privacy cover when not in use. The all-in-one design is really convenient to use and reduces a whole heap of potential cable clutter in my setup.",,

The companion app lets you add extra filters, play with the exposure and focus modes, and even dabble in light painting. It also comes with adaptable color lens filters for some seriously unique shots you’d want to display on the shelf rather than tuck it away. The retro aesthetic looks like it could belong on the set of Stranger Things. It’s a whole lot of fun to use, especially with friends. And if you're into photography and love to hold and look at physical prints, this is a worthwhile retro gadget at only $150. Retro and tech gadgets don’t seem like they belong in the same sentence, but the Polaroid Now Plus pulls it off pretty well.

In 2016, TEAMGROUP also established T-FORCE and T-CREATE brand. According to the latest USB-IF specification that announced in 2019. SuperSpeed USB 3.2 Gen1(5Gbps) is equal to the past USB 3.1 Gen1 and USB 3.0 specification. And SuperSpeed+ USB 3.2 Gen2 will rise from Gen2 by 1(10Gbps) to Gen2 by 2(20Gbps). This is probably because your USB disk and another drive (e.g. web drive) use the same drive letter. To solve the problem, follow the instructions below to change the drive letter of your USB disk. Please follow: Right click[Management] Select [Disk management] Right-click the USB disk and select the Change Drive Letter and Path option from the function menu. This is due to a unit capacity conversion issue. Hardware manufacturers usually define 1K=1000 bytes according to decimal, while software providers (ex: Microsoft) define 1K=1024 bytes according to binary. In addition manufacturers retain 3~5% of capacity for firmware, application software, and data storage maintenance. So there is the difference between actual capacity and marked capacity.

It’s Team Group’s newly released one terabyte C212 Extreme Speed USB. It’s a high capacity USB that’s as fast as an SSD drive and doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. Straight out of the box, it looks like any other USB drive with a nifty slider that pushes and pulls out a USB 3.2 Type A connector out of the housing. The slider reminds me of the old school SanDisk Glide USBs back in the day, anyone remember those? It’s also super light at only 9 grams and fits right into your pocket. Here’s the impressive, mind-blowing part: it transfers files at 600 megabytes per second, which is faster than some SSD drives out there. It takes only less than 30 seconds to transfer a 10 gigabyte file. This makes it one of the fastest high capacity USB drives on the market right now and is pretty affordable at $120 on Amazon. I use it to quickly transfer video files between computers or share big files with my team or friends, for example. It’s much easier than lugging around an external hard drive or even your laptop.

With a solid full aluminum frame, the Q1 is designed for premium typing comfort and endless possibility.

• All-Around Customizable Keyboard: To build a fully customizable keyboard, we designed every component easily assembled. With full QMK and VIA support, you can easily program and remap each key on the keyboard. The open-source firmware means endless possibilities for keyboard layouts, shortcuts, backlight effects, even the knob, and more.

• Hot-swappable Support: With the pre-lubed Gateron G Pro mechanical tactile brown switch providing unrivaled tactile responsiveness with up to 50 million keystroke lifespan. You can also hot-swap the Q3 with almost all of the 3pin and 5pin MX mechanical switches on the market (including Cherry, Gateron, Kailh, Panda, etc.) without soldering required. The PCB-mounted screw-in stabilizer for “big keys” such as space bar, shift, enter, and delete are designed for less wobbliness.

• Innovative Double Gasket: This Double-Gasket Structure allows the keyboard to maintain the flexibility of the gasket structure and improves the overall typing sound. We added silicone pads between the top and bottom cases to significantly reduce the sound resonance between the metals and reduce the noise of the impacted metals.

• Double-shot PBT Keycaps & South-facing Backlight: The Q1 comes with our unique OSA profile and double-shot PBT keycaps that aim to provide a more comfortable and subtle fingertip feel with excellent oil resistance for long-term use.

It’s the ultimate travel companion for music lovers because not only is it a smart speaker, and not only is it portable, and not only is it waterproof, it also sounds damn good for the small size and price. It’s so rugged and portable with its triangular design; you can throw it around and throw it into a backpack without worrying about it. I’ve traveled to a few countries since getting this, and I genuinely think it’s one of the best, if not the best, portable speaker that you can get on the market right now. It’s perfect for hotel sing-alongs or beachside tunes, and my friends and family seem to really appreciate this tech gadget too when I take it out and about.",,

Now, before you say, “Damn, $168 for a water pitcher,” of course, this isn’t just a water pitcher on this list. This is another healthy gadget worth getting. This water pitcher smartly tracks your water consumption and habits via the app and filters your water in two ways: through a physical filter and also through this really nifty UV light filtration which LARQ claims to eliminate 99.9% of germs in the water and the pitcher itself. I can personally vouch for it. Coming from a Brita jug, which always formed nasty green algae on the jug after a month – apparently, it’s fine to drink from, but it just doesn’t look nice – the rechargeable UV light on the LARQ has stopped any algae from forming since I got it, and it’s been pretty interesting to see the filtering stats and water consumption stats on the app. If you can’t tell by now, I really like nice looking things, and this pitcher looks and feels high-end. This one here is in the very clean, pure white colorway, and it doesn’t look out of place in my home office or kitchen.",,
