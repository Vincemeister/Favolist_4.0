Consistent with their tagline, “organic hard kombucha for a brighter buzz,” I do get a nice buzz, as it sports a hefty 6% ABV (alcohol by volume), but 1–2 drinks doesn’t punish me with a nasty hangover. I enjoy grabbing a can of JuneShine in the late afternoon after a workday or when hanging with friends on the weekend. You’ve also heard me drinking JuneShine in a few Random Show episodes with Kevin Rose. Grapefruit Paloma might be my personal favorite flavor, but I usually grab a Sampler Pack and rotate.

","Gadget I’m enjoying, a 2018 TIME magazine invention of the year. For some reason, I lose pot lids. I have a motley crew of cookware, and half of them are missing covers. Perhaps it was my move from CA to TX, or perhaps it’s simply the fact that lids are easily confused with one another and a pain to store. Imagine my glee when I found a single gadget that gets rid of the headache: a one-size-fits-nearly-all silicone pot cover. Just get a few of them, and you’re set.

Kelly Starrett (@thereadystate) of The Ready State recommended the Marc Pro, and it reduced the swelling more than 50% after two two-hour sessions. The transformation was incredible.

With the publication of his best-selling Of Wolves and Men, and with the astonishing originality of Arctic Dreams, Barry Lopez established himself as that rare writer whose every book is an event, for both critics and his devoted readership. Now, in About This Life, he takes us on a literal and figurative journey across the terrain of autobiography, assembling essays of great wisdom and insight.

Here is far-flung travel (the beauty of remote Hokkaido Island, the over-explored Galápagos, enigmatic Bonaire); a naturalist's contention (Why does our society inevitably strip political power from people with intimate knowledge of the land small-scale farmers, Native Americans, Eskimos, cowboys?); and pure adventure (a dizzying series of around-the-world journeys with air freight everything from penguins to pianos). And here, too, are seven exquisite memory pieces hauntingly lyrical yet unsentimental recollections that represent Lopez's most personal work to date, and which will be read as classics of the personal essay for years to come.

In writing about nature and people from around the world, by exploring the questions of our age, and, above all, by sharing a new openness about himself, Barry Lopez gives us a book that is at once vastly erudite yet intimate: a magically written and provocative work by a major American writer at the top of his form.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71n07aDpqcL._SL1193_.jpg,"I have fallen in love with Barry Lopez’s writing. If you’re new to his work, I would suggest reading Of Wolves and Men or Arctic Dreams first, as they are nonfiction at its best. About This Life is a mostly autobiographical collection of essays. In descending order, my favorites thus far are: “Learning to See,” “Orchids on the Volcanoes,” and “Apologia.”

Gwynedd Hudson was a British artist and designer who created exceptional illustrations for Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Peter Pan.

Inspired by Michael Schur, I decided to buy a beautiful, old book with illustrations, just for the joy of traipsing through a tactile and visual feast. I decided on this 1982 reissue of the 1922 first Hudson-illustrated edition of Alice in Wonderland. It cost me $175 (here it is for $290), but there are many vintage editions available for far less.

But who's flipping it? A thought-provoking and brilliantly entertaining work of nonfiction from one of the world's leading deceivers, the creator and star of the astonishing theater show and forthcoming film In & Of Itself.

Derek DelGaudio believed he was a decent, honest man. But when irrefutable evidence to the contrary is found in an old journal, his memories are reawakened and Derek is forced to confront--and try to understand--his role in a significant act of deception from his past.

Using his youthful notebook entries as a road map, Derek embarks on a soulful, often funny, sometimes dark journey, retracing the path that led him to a world populated by charlatans, card cheats, and con artists. As stories are peeled away and artifices are revealed, Derek examines the mystery behind his father's vanishing act, the secret he inherited from his mother, the obsession he developed with sleight-of-hand that shaped his future, and the affinity he felt for the professional swindlers who taught him how to deceive others. And once he finds himself working as a crooked dealer in a big-money Hollywood card game, Derek begins to question his own sense of morality, and discovers that even a master of deception can find himself trapped inside an illusion.

A M O R A L M A N is a wildly engaging exploration of the fictions we live as truths. It is ultimately a book about the lies we tell ourselves and the realities we manufacture in others.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1cJRv42EXL._SL1500_.jpg,"From the description: “Derek DelGaudio believed he was a decent, honest man.

It is in these very transformations--sometimes dubious, sometimes oddly sentimental--that the book's critical edge is sharpest.

Using a Body Back Buddy to apply sustained pressure to a trigger point can interrupt the pain-spasm cycle. When you release the pressure, you will feel the muscle relax as fresh oxygenated blood flows in.

• 2 Hooks Are Better Than 1- The 2 hooks and 11 knobs (in 3 different shapes) were created to alleviate pain and soreness across the entire body. Unlike single muscle hook designs, the two hooks on the Body Back Buddy let you apply more leverage to more parts of the body. The 3 different shapes include acorns for deep tissue, round for gliding over larger muscle groups, and nubs for the lower back.

• Full Body Pain Relief - Designed to be the only massage tool you need to achieve fast, simple relief for your whole body. More than just a shoulder massager, the Body Back Buddy is built to directly target pressure points throughout the body located in the back, neck, shoulders, legs, feet, and thighs.

• Won't Bend or Break - The sturdy one piece construction is lab tested to be up to 30% stronger than other therapy canes. You can see and feel the difference. No assembly required. Ships to you ready to use out of the box.

Now in a beautiful paperback edition, David Lynch's Catching the Big Fish provides a rare window into the internationally acclaimed filmmaker's methods as an artist, his personal working style, and the immense creative benefits he has experienced from the practice of meditation.

Catching the Big Fish comes as a revelation to the legion of fans who have longed to better understand Lynch's personal vision. And it is equally compelling to those who wonder how they can nurture their own creativity.

Catching Ideas

Ideas are like fish.

If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you've got to go deeper.

Down deep, the fish are more powerful and more pure. They're huge and abstract. And they're very beautiful.

I look for a certain kind of fish that is important to me, one that can translate to cinema. But there are all kinds of fish swimming down there. There are fish for business, fish for sports. There are fish for everything.

Everything, anything that is a thing, comes up from the deepest level. Modern physics calls that level the Unified Field. The more your consciousness-your awareness-is expanded, the deeper you go toward this source, and the bigger the fish you can catch.

Draft No. 4 is a master class on the writer’s craft. In a series of playful, expertly wrought essays, John McPhee shares insights he has gathered over his career and has refined while teaching at Princeton University, where he has nurtured some of the most esteemed writers of recent decades. McPhee offers definitive guidance in the decisions regarding arrangement, diction, and tone that shape nonfiction pieces, and he presents extracts from his work, subjecting them to wry scrutiny. In one essay, he considers the delicate art of getting sources to tell you what they might not otherwise reveal. In another, he discusses how to use flashback to place a bear encounter in a travel narrative while observing that “readers are not supposed to notice the structure. It is meant to be about as visible as someone’s bones.” The result is a vivid depiction of the writing process, from reporting to drafting to revising―and revising, and revising.

Draft No. 4 is enriched by multiple diagrams and by personal anecdotes and charming reflections on the life of a writer. McPhee describes his enduring relationships with The New Yorker and Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and recalls his early years at Time magazine.

Try the upside-down drawing exercise once, and it might just blow your mind. As Betty puts it in the Introduction: “Many of my readers have intuitively understood that this book is not only about learning to draw, and it is certainly not about Art with a capital A. The true subject is perception. Yes, the lessons have helped many people attain the basic ability to draw, and that is a main purpose of the book. But the larger underlying purpose was always to … teach readers how to see in new ways, with hopes that they would discover how to transfer perceptual skills to thinking and problem solving.”


​
​Ed Catmull, co-founder of Pixar, said practically the same thing in our hour-long conversation together. Learning how to make basic ‘art’ isn’t frivolous—it teaches you, first and foremost, how to *see* the life around you much more clearly. Learning even primitive drawing, which you can do in a few afternoons, will fundamentally change how you see the world. As Betty writes: “My students’ most frequent comment after learning to draw is ‘Life seems much richer now that I am seeing more.’” ​

“Grand and dizzying in how thoroughly it recalibrates our understanding of the natural world.”—Ed Yong, author of An Immense World

ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR—Time, BBC Science Focus, The Daily Mail, Geographical, The Times, The Telegraph, New Statesman, London Evening Standard, Science Friday

When we think of fungi, we likely think of mushrooms. But mushrooms are only fruiting bodies, analogous to apples on a tree. Most fungi live out of sight, yet make up a massively diverse kingdom of organisms that supports and sustains nearly all living systems. Fungi provide a key to understanding the planet on which we live, and the ways we think, feel, and behave.

In the first edition of this mind-bending book, Sheldrake introduced us to this mysterious but massively diverse kingdom of life. This exquisitely designed volume, abridged from the original, features more than one hundred full-color images that bring the spectacular variety, strangeness, and beauty of fungi to life as never before.

Fungi throw our concepts of individuality and even intelligence into question. They are metabolic masters, earth makers, and key players in most of life’s processes. They can change our minds, heal our bodies, and even help us remediate environmental disaster. By examining fungi on their own terms, Sheldrake reveals how these extraordinary organisms—and our relationships with them—are changing our understanding of how life works.

Kennedy Library and with the never-before-published safari journal of Hemingway’s second wife, Pauline Pfeiffer.

When it was first published in 1935, The New York Times called Green Hills of Africa, “The best-written story of big-game hunting anywhere,” Hemingway’s evocative account of his safari through East Africa with his wife, Pauline Pfeiffer, captures his fascination with big-game hunting. In examining the grace of the chase and the ferocity of the kill, Hemingway looks inward, seeking to explain the lure of the hunt and the primal undercurrent that comes alive on the plains of Africa. Green Hills of Africa is also an impassioned portrait of the glory of the African landscape and the beauty of a wilderness that was, even then, being threatened by the incursions of man.

This new Hemingway Library Edition offers a fresh perspective on Hemingway’s classic travelogue, with a personal foreword by Patrick Hemingway, the author’s sole surviving son, who spent many years as a professional hunter in East Africa; a new introduction by Seán Hemingway, grandson of the author; and, published for the first time in its entirety, the African journal of Hemingway’s wife, Pauline, which offers an intimate glimpse into thoughts and experiences that shaped her husband’s craft.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-vD0MQ-QL._SL1500_.jpg

Before reading, I would suggest taking a few minutes to glance at 1–2 pictures of a few recurring animals: kudu, sable antelope, oryx, wildebeest, white rhino, and water buffalo.

Hemingway’s well-known interest in—and fascination with—big-game hunting is magnificently captured in this evocative account of his trip. In examining the poetic grace of the chase, and the ferocity of the kill, Hemingway also looks inward, seeking to explain the lure of the hunt and the primal undercurrent that comes alive on the plains of Africa.

Even though we were living a “healthy” lifestyle - no junk food, some exercise, and some label reading - we weren’t really thriving. So Jordan, our co-founder and corporate defector, immersed himself in all things food: the gut-brain connection, systemic inflammation, the impact of certain foods and additives on our health, and where potentially harmful things are hiding in our food supply. Then he teamed up with his sister Jess. Together, they founded the restaurant (and chocolate line) they wished had existed. Now it does. Welcome to Hu, where we’re Getting Back To Human by creating food for humans.

• GLUTEN FREE CRACKERS: Our Gluten Free Crackers made with NO Gluten, NO Grains, NO Refined Starches, NO Sunflower Oil, NO Dairy, NO Seed/Vegetable Oils, NO Corn, NO Rice, NO Soy

• PALEO CRACKERS: 8g Net Carbs, 1g Sugar, 2g Dietary Fiber, 3g Protein, 6g fat, 90 Calories for 26 Cracker serving

• LOW CARB CRACKERS: Our Crisply Crackers are baked and made with a unique blend of almond, whole cassava and coconut flour.

• GET BACK TO HUMAN: (Hu as in HUman) The goal isn’t to just get by. The goal is to live actively, age gracefully, and flourish. We started Hu to help people get back to eating, living, and thriving like humans. Our journey started with asking questions about our food, which lead us down a crazy rabbit hole of health and wellness discovery. We decided to cut through the clutter and focus on the simple things to get back to human.

Although the consciousness of death is, in most cultures, very much a part of life, this is perhaps nowhere more true than in Japan, where the approach of death has given rise to a centuries-old tradition of writing jisei, or the ""death poem."" Such a poem is often written in the very last moments of the poet's life.

Hundreds of Japanese death poems, many with a commentary describing the circumstances of the poet's death, have been translated into English here, the vast majority of them for the first time. Yoel Hoffmann explores the attitudes and customs surrounding death in historical and present-day Japan and gives examples of how these have been reflected in the nation's literature in general. The development of writing jisei is then examined--from the longing poems of the early nobility and the more ""masculine"" verses of the samurai to the satirical death poems of later centuries.

Zen Buddhist ideas about death are also described as a preface to the collection of Chinese death poems by Zen monks that are also included. Finally, the last section contains three hundred twenty haiku, some of which have never been assembled before, in English translation and romanized in Japanese.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tPms8zRIL._SL1500_.jpg,"This was gifted to me by a dear friend and ultra-high performer.

Know how to navigate, don’t worry about the destination, and stay alert. These are just a few of the strategies that contribute to both successful lion tracking and a life of fulfillment. When we join Boyd Varty and his two friends tracking lions, we are immersed in the South African bush, and, although we learn some of the skills required for actual tracking, the takeaways are the strategies that can be applied to our everyday lives. Trackers learn how to use all of their senses to read the environment and enter into a state of “greater aliveness.” When we learn to find and follow our inner tracks, we learn to see what is deeply important to us. In the same way the trip in the classic Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was a vehicle to examine how to live out our values, the story of this one-day adventure—with danger and suspense along the way—uses the ancient art of tracking to convey profound lessons on how to live a purposeful, meaningful life of greater harmony.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NkyfhCvKL._SL1500_.jpg,"This is a short and wonderful book.

From New York Times bestselling author Lionel Shriver, a near-future novel that explores the aftershocks of an economically devastating U.S. sovereign debt default on four generations of a once-prosperous American family

In 2029, the United States is engaged in a bloodless world war that will wipe out the savings of millions of American families. Overnight, on the international currency exchange, the “almighty dollar” plummets in value, to be replaced by a new global currency, the “bancor.” In retaliation, the president declares that America will default on its loans. “Deadbeat Nation” being unable to borrow, the government prints money to cover its bills. What little remains to savers is rapidly eaten away by runaway inflation.

The Mandibles have been counting on a sizable fortune filtering down when their ninety-seven-year-old patriarch dies. Once the inheritance turns to ash, each family member must contend with disappointment, but also—as the U.S. economy spirals into dysfunction—the challenge of sheer survival.

Recently affluent, Avery is petulant that she can’t buy olive oil, while her sister, Florence, absorbs strays into her cramped household. An expat author, their aunt, Nollie, returns from abroad at seventy-three to a country that’s unrecognizable. Her brother, Carter, fumes at caring for their demented stepmother, now that an assisted living facility isn’t affordable. Only Florence’s oddball teenage son, Willing, an economics autodidact, will save this formerly august American family from the streets.

The Mandibles is about money. Thus it is necessarily about bitterness, rivalry, and selfishness—but also about surreal generosity, sacrifice, and transformative adaptation to changing circumstances.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41sTHwJoAnL._SL1429_.jpg,"​By Lionel Shriver (best known for We Need to Talk About Kevin) and narrated by George Newbern. From the description: “With dry wit and psychological acuity, this near-future novel explores the aftershocks of an economically devastating US sovereign debt default on four generations of a once-prosperous American family. Down-to-earth and perfectly realistic in scale, this is not an over-the-top Blade Runner tale. It is not science fiction.” Before committing too hard to a near-term dystopian future, however, it’s a good idea to read the predictions in Market Wizards: Interviews with Top Traders, first published in 1989. The end has been nigh for the US for a long time, but it’s still ticking 30+ years later, albeit with some serious bugs. Special thanks to J. for both recommendations",,,

Applying his superior skills of logic and problem solving to the issue of happiness, he proposes an algorithm based on an understanding of how the brain takes in and processes joy and sadness. Then he solves for happy.

In 2001 Mo Gawdat realized that despite his incredible success, he was desperately unhappy. A lifelong learner, he attacked the problem as an engineer would: examining all the provable facts and scrupulously applying logic. Eventually, his countless hours of research and science proved successful, and he discovered the equation for permanent happiness.

Thirteen years later, Mo's algorithm would be put to the ultimate test. After the sudden death of his son, Ali, Mo and his family turned to his equation—and it saved them from despair. In dealing with the horrible loss, Mo found his mission: he would pull off the type of ""moonshot"" goal that he and his colleagues were always aiming for—he would share his equation with the world and help as many people as possible become happier.

In Solve for Happy Mo questions some of the most fundamental aspects of our existence, shares the underlying reasons for suffering, and plots out a step-by-step process for achieving lifelong happiness and enduring contentment. He shows us how to view life through a clear lens, teaching us how to dispel the illusions that cloud our thinking; overcome the brain's blind spots; and embrace five ultimate truths.

The roadmap for finding purpose, meaning, and success as we age, from bestselling author, Harvard professor, and the Atlantic's happiness columnist Arthur Brooks.

Many of us assume that the more successful we are, the less susceptible we become to the sense of professional and social irrelevance that often accompanies aging. But the truth is, the greater our achievements and our attachment to them, the more we notice our decline, and the more painful it is when it occurs.

What can we do, starting now, to make our older years a time of happiness, purpose, and yes, success?

At the height of his career at the age of 50, Arthur Brooks embarked on a seven-year journey to discover how to transform his future from one of disappointment over waning abilities into an opportunity for progress. From Strength to Strength is the result, a practical roadmap for the rest of your life.

Drawing on social science, philosophy, biography, theology, and eastern wisdom, as well as dozens of interviews with everyday men and women, Brooks shows us that true life success is well within our reach. By refocusing on certain priorities and habits that anyone can learn, such as deep wisdom, detachment from empty rewards, connection and service to others, and spiritual progress, we can set ourselves up for increased happiness.

Read this book and you, too, can go from strength to strength.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1vJ-YLcUVL._SL1500_.jpg,"Thank you to Peter Attia, MD (@PeterAttiaMD) for the recommendation.

Anthropologist and National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Wade Davis leads us on a thrilling journey to celebrate the wisdom of the world’s indigenous cultures.
In Polynesia we set sail with navigators whose ancestors settled the Pacific ten centuries before Christ. In the Amazon we meet the descendants of a true Lost Civilization, the people of the Anaconda. In the Andes we discover that the Earth really is alive, while in the far reaches of Australia we experience Dreamtime, the all-embracing philosophy of the first humans to walk out of Africa. We then travel to Nepal, where we encounter a wisdom hero, a Bodhisattva, who emerges from forty-five years of Buddhist retreat and solitude. And finally we settle in Borneo, where the last rainforest nomads struggle to survive.
Understanding the lessons of this journey will be our mission for the next century. For at risk is the human legacy  a vast archive of knowledge and expertise, a catalogue of the imagination. Rediscovering a new appreciation for the diversity of the human spirit, as expressed by culture, is among the central challenges of our time.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZAEiSujPL._SL1500_.jpg,"Huge thanks to Maryanna Saenko (🙌), Steve Jurvetson (@FutureJurvetson), and the team from Future Ventures (@FutureVenturesVC) for this one.

She followed with two other smash bestsellers: Cherry and Lit, which were critical hits as well.

For thirty years Karr has also taught the form, winning teaching prizes at Syracuse. (The writing program there produced such acclaimed authors as Cheryl Strayed, Koren Zailckas and Keith Gessen.) in the Art of Memoir, she synthesizes her expertise as professor and therapy patient, writer and spiritual seeker, recovered alcoholic and “black-belt sinner,” providing a unique window into the mechanics and art of the form that is as irreverent, insightful and entertaining as her own work in the genre.

Anchored by excerpts from her favorite memoirs and anecdotes from fellow writers’ experience, the Art of Memoir lays bare Karr’s own process. As she breaks down the key elements of great literary memoir, she breaks open our concepts of memory and identity and illuminates the cathartic power of reflecting on the past; anybody with an inner life or complicated history, whether writer or reader, will relate.

The Art of Memoir is a stunning tour de force from an accomplished master pulling back the curtain on her craft.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SViXnJ85L._SL1500_.jpg,"What I’m rereading — I’ve long been fascinated by Mary Karr (@marykarrlit), and I originally picked up her book on the craft of memoir writing after a recommendation by Michael Pollan. It applies to much of life, and I’d consider it a philosophical guide in many respects, replete with the dead serious (e.g., how to communicate past abuse) and spit-up-your-coffee funny (e.g., catshit sandwich metaphors). If you work with the written word in any capacity, I highly recommend. For more Mary, check out my recent podcast interview with her.",,,

In the past month, I’ve been “rucking” instead—hiking or walking with weight on my back—2–4x per week. I’m astonished by how much I love it. Huffing on trails while listening to a well-narrated audiobook (currently trying Island by Aldous Huxley) has proven hugely therapeutic, and it can turn an unpleasant day around. For the basics of training, check out this link. The gear isn’t cheap, but even if you only have a short circuit, this can change the game. At 165 pounds, I most often do 2.5-mile loops while carrying 30 pounds in the Rucker, and I’ll soon work up to 45–55 pounds. Given some past hip and back issues, I’m progressing slowly. Below is one guideline from their site:

“Our recommendation: start with 20 lbs, progress in increments of ~10 lbs., and ultimately max out at ⅓ of your bodyweight. It’s more important to keep proper form than to have more weight. If you’re looking for a greater challenge at any weight, ruck faster.”",,,

Big Game pursuits vary from one species or environment to another, but they all share a common thread: crossing expanses of terrain to get within striking distance of animals that are infinitely better suited to these wild places. Hunting big game requires physical endurance and adaptation to constantly changing conditions and activity levels. SITKA Big Game products give hunters the tools needed to excel in these challenging conditions. From blistering heat to frigid winter storms and dense forests to desolate rocky ridges, our specialized systems are built to enhance performance with advanced fabrics, specialized design, and the only concealment patterns scientifically designed to confuse the vision of big game animals. Whitetail deer possess hyperactive senses of smell and hearing. They can also see the most subtle movement even at distance or elevation. SITKA Whitetail products feature advanced fabrics and designs that minimize noise and scent and regulate body temperature across a wide range of conditions, working with the hunter to enhance focus and precision. They also utilize the only concealment pattern scientifically engineered to confuse the vision of deer: GORE OPTIFADE Concealment Elevated II. From the timber to the marsh and meandering rivers to the open ocean, waterfowl hunting conditions and strategies vary far and wide. SITKA Waterfowl Systems integrate into any hunt, offering versatile layering options, refined fits, advanced technologies and specialized features designed to completely optimize the waterfowl experience. They also offer the only waterfowl patterns scientifically engineered around the vision of descending ducks and geese: GORE OPTIFADE Concealment Waterfowl Marsh and GORE OPTIFADE Concealment Waterfowl Timber. As hunters, we seek a closer connection to the land and wildlife that sustain us. This extends beyond any given hunting season and helps to define how we live year-round. SITKA’s endeavor is to use design, fabric and construction technologies to improve the lives of our Tribe. This means training. This means travel. This means work. GORE-TEX TECHNOLOGY - Garments engineered with GORE-TEX durable fabrics are waterproof, windproof, and very breathable allowing them to provide reliable weather protection and maximized comfort in all weather conditions! GORE WINDSTOPPER TECHNOLOGY - Shelters hunters from the adverse effects of bone-chilling winds. The membrane works with our base layers to prevent overheating and perspiration build-up by allowing moisture vapor to easily escape. The unique fabrics offer soft, lightweight weather protection in one versatile and durable garment. PRIMALOFT TECHNOLOGY - PrimaLoft products are the ultimate in insulation technology for hunters. Ultra-fine fibers are engineered to retain maximum warmth even when wet, and create a product that is quiet and less bulky, allowing for greater freedom of movement. POLYGIENE ODOR CONTROL TECHNOLOGY - When sweat mixes with odor-causing bacteria on fabrics, odor results.Polygiene technology safely and permanently neutralizes odors using naturally antimicrobial silver salt.

Logen Ninefingers, infamous barbarian, has finally run out of luck. Caught in one feud too many, he's on the verge of becoming a dead barbarian -- leaving nothing behind him but bad songs, dead friends, and a lot of happy enemies.

Nobleman, dashing officer, and paragon of selfishness, Captain Jezal dan Luthar has nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing his friends at cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing circle. But war is brewing, and on the battlefields of the frozen North they fight by altogether bloodier rules.

Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer, would like nothing better than to see Jezal come home in a box. But then Glokta hates everyone: cutting treason out of the Union one confession at a time leaves little room for friendship. His latest trail of corpses may lead him right to the rotten heart of government, if he can stay alive long enough to follow it.

Enter the wizard, Bayaz. A bald old man with a terrible temper and a pathetic assistant, he could be the First of the Magi, he could be a spectacular fraud, but whatever he is, he's about to make the lives of Logen, Jezal, and Glokta a whole lot more difficult.

Note that I would likely buy the 1700 version next time to have a longer battery life, but these less expensive 1300s are great for sessions of six hours or less. This system has three heating intensities, and a roughly six-hour session is using the second, middle intensity.

If you keep it on the lowest setting, I think it’s fair to assume you could get 10 hours, but I have Raynaud’s disease, and my toes get abnormally cold. Another tip that is counterintuitive: thin socks can often make your feet feel warmer. If your ski boots are tight, and thicker socks make them tighter, you can impede blood flow and make those little piglets even more frigid.",,,

Pro Traction Cleats fit over shoes and are secured with a durable rubber strap that ensures an excellent fit. Traction is provided by a shaped-edge coil design that provides unequaled stability on ice and snow, letting users move about naturally with the same solid grip as on dry surfaces. Yaktrax Pro Traction Cleats are made of high-strength, abrasion and rust-resistant 1.4 mm steel coils and heavy-duty natural rubber to help the cleats easily conform to the shape of any boot or shoe. Multiple coil angles provide 360 degrees of traction on cold surfaces for stability in all directions. Because Yaktrax Pro Traction cleats have been tested in temperatures as low as -41 degrees Fahrenheit, they can be worn in a variety of environments, from icy Wisconsin streets to packed-snow trails in wintery woods. Yaktrax Pro Traction Cleats are available in small, medium, large, and extra-large sizes to fit most shoes: Small (fits shoe size W6.5-10, M5-8.5); Medium (fits shoe size W10.5-12.5, M9-11); Large (fits shoe size W13-15, M11.5-13.5); X-Larger (fits shoe size W15.5+, M 14+). For oversized shoes or boots, Yaktrax recommends purchasing one size larger than your normal shoe size.

","I love the XPO Trainer. Recommended to me by elite powerlifter Mark Bell (check his other gear here; our podcast together here), it is effectively a “prowler” with mechanical resistance. I was initially skeptical, but it’s been one of my favorite torture tools for years now. The harder you push, the harder it pushes back, and the wheels allow me to easily use this anywhere. Perhaps counterintuitively, it is much more difficult to use on asphalt than soft or loose surfaces, which suits my urban environment perfectly. No weight plates are required. The XPO is not made in high volume, and it’s a bit expensive, so here are a few alternatives that are most suitable for grass or sand. I use the 1.0 version of the XPO Trainer, but there are newer models available. Bonus: If you want to see a walk-through of Mark’s incredible gym, here’s a video we shot together that showcases his favorite toys. If you have a push sled, a few kettlebells, a jump rope, and a weighted rucksack, you can get in exceptional shape quickly.",,,

","What I’m wearing on hikes for tick protection — I’ve contracted Lyme disease twice. Lyme seems to be a tax for many people who grow up on Long Island, and I have no desire for a third experience. These ElimiTick pants were gifted to me by a dear friend, and… they really seem to work. I wore them on a recent hike (forgoing tick-repellent spray) and came back with no ticks whatsoever. The person with me later found more than a dozen ticks on their clothing and skin. I’ll roll the dice with intermittent permethrin—or whatever they use—instead of rolling the dice with ticks and then downing 200mg of doxycycline as the morning-after pill. Also, for the many people who’ve asked me about recovery from Lyme: (1) I’m not an expert and no MD, but (2) antibiotics plus a strict ketogenic diet (but neither alone) seemed to be the key for me, and I’ve since seen that replicated by a few friends. Could be placebo, of course, but we do what we can…",,,

The hood is high-necked and close fitting. It therefore keeps the throat and neck comfortably warm when the hood is down. Good to know: The flat knitting technique makes the THERMOVENT HOODY extra sustainable as no cutting waste is created during production. No more than is absolutely necessary has been knitted.

The dialogue is burst-out-loud funny, and the writing is spectacularly visual. I’d heard the name Lonesome Dove many times over the years, and I finally dove in after a friend mentioned that it’s his all-time favorite book. Here’s the description: “A love story, an adventure, and an epic of the frontier, Larry McMurtry’s Pulitzer Prize-winning classic, Lonesome Dove, is the grandest novel ever written about the last defiant wilderness of America. Two retired Texas Rangers, Captains Woodrow Call and Augustus ‘Gus’ McCrae, lead a cattle drive from the small town of Lonesome Dove to the unsettled Montana territories. On their grueling journey, they are joined by Joshua Deets, a Black scout and former Ranger; Jake Spoon, a fugitive; and Newt Dobbs, a 17-year-old boy who may have family ties to Call.”

Even if you end up reading the text, listen to 30–60 minutes of the audiobook for narrator Lee Horsley’s accents and performance. Warning: Gus can be high-volume, as he’s a loudmouth in the book, and there is one tough stretch via audio about one-third in. I was tempted to put it down briefly, as was a friend, so just power through or switch to text. It evens out after that and simply gets better and better with each short chapter.",,,
