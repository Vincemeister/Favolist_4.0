It’s waterproof up to 50 meters and the ability to stitch together 4K 360-degree footage is unrivaled. It’s a must in any traveler’s backpack if you’re off to any action-filled destination.

14 Premium Tech Gadgets You’ve Never Heard Of! (JUL 22),,,https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Mechanical-Programmable-Hot-swappable-Compatible/dp/B09TXCVSS7?th=1,Keychron Q1 Wired Custom Mechanical Keyboard Knob Version,199.99,"• 82 Keys Full Aluminum Frame: The Q1 Knob Version is a fully customizable mechanical keyboard with 75% layout that push your typing experience to the top. With a solid full aluminum frame, the Q1 is designed for premium typing comfort and endless possibility.

• All-Around Customizable Keyboard: To build a fully customizable keyboard, we designed every component easily assembled. With full QMK and VIA support, you can easily program and remap each key on the keyboard. The open-source firmware means endless possibilities for keyboard layouts, shortcuts, backlight effects, even the knob, and more.

• Hot-swappable Support: With the pre-lubed Gateron G Pro mechanical tactile brown switch providing unrivaled tactile responsiveness with up to 50 million keystroke lifespan. You can also hot-swap the Q3 with almost all of the 3pin and 5pin MX mechanical switches on the market (including Cherry, Gateron, Kailh, Panda, etc.) without soldering required. The PCB-mounted screw-in stabilizer for “big keys” such as space bar, shift, enter, and delete are designed for less wobbliness.

• Innovative Double Gasket: This Double-Gasket Structure allows the keyboard to maintain the flexibility of the gasket structure and improves the overall typing sound. We added silicone pads between the top and bottom cases to significantly reduce the sound resonance between the metals and reduce the noise of the impacted metals.

• Double-shot PBT Keycaps & South-facing Backlight: The Q1 comes with our unique OSA profile and double-shot PBT keycaps that aim to provide a more comfortable and subtle fingertip feel with excellent oil resistance for long-term use. The south-facing RGB is designed to better illuminate the keyboard backlight from the typist’s angle and free from interference when the user installs Cherry- profile alternative keycaps on the Q1.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HMi3xVAbL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gtaDLyX+L._AC_SL1500_.jpg","The new Keychron Q1 keyboard is an iconic mechanical keyboard but with a bit of a twist – literally. On the Q1, we get this programmable knob here, so you can set functions for your favorite apps. So, for example, you could zoom in and out on Photoshop, adjust your screen brightness or volume, scroll through a timeline, or even dim your smart lights from your keyboard. This is the complete aluminum version, so it’s really sturdy but weighs a freaking ton. I’ve also customized the keycaps to blue accents for a personal touch, and of course, they’re amazing and sound amazing to type on. But if you’re serious about customization and getting access to more controls at the tip of your fingers, you’ll need to check out this gadget here, which is the slick Loupedeck Live. It’s a little pocket-sized deck you plug into your computer so you get access to multiple knobs, touch screens, buttons, and controls, and it helps speed up my creative tasks like photo, video, and audio editing. It also connects up to a whole load of apps like Blender, Google Chrome, smart light, Spotify, Twitch – almost anyone can find use out of this small package. I’m not sure I’d pay $549 for the Loupedeck CT, though, which gets you a few more buttons and knobs since the Loupedeck Live is already $269, so it’s not exactly cheap. And also, a heads up, it’s only compatible with Lightroom Classic, not Lightroom CC, which is a big letdown in my opinion.",,
