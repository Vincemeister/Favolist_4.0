The desk has truly been a game changer. The fact that you can customize it to your aesthetic preference while also benefiting from its functionality, it's great. That glass top? While it might seem fancy to some, I appreciate the no-nonsense approach of just using the metal top. It's sleek, it's minimal, and it does the job. Plus, the contrast of the white surface with the black legs – it's a visual treat. Definitely worth the investment, especially if you're spending hours at your workspace like me. Remember, investing in where you spend your most time can be vital for productivity and comfort. And this desk? It delivers on both fronts.",,

Beginning with the legendary NS-10M, and continuing with the MSP and previous HS series, this new lineup shares a design philosophy that emphasizes sonic purity without any coloring or alternation of the original sound. While many manufacturers seek to enhance the sound of their monitors to make them sound impressive, Yamaha studio monitors are designed to achieve the best possible mix by ensuring that the sound from your speakers is true to the original. Hs series nearfield reference monitors are the embodiment of this philosophy, delivering a concise sound image, high resolution, and flat response.

No matter how good your mixer, mics, preamps, cables, and other pieces of gear that you’ve invested in, you’re not truly hearing what your recordings sound like until you isolate your monitors from their environment. This is where the Auralex MoPAD-XLs come in. MoPAD-XL Monitor Isolation Pads provide sonic isolation between your monitors and whatever your monitors are resting on, INSTANTLY improving the accuracy of your entire monitoring system. MoPAD-XLs are designed so that they can be used to support virtually all sizes of bookshelf loudspeakers or recording monitors up to 100 lbs. each (or up to 200 lbs. with a pair per monitor). While most smaller loudspeakers may be sufficiently supported by a single MoPAD-XL, many require the support of two MoPAD-XLs (1 pair per monitor). MoPAD-XLs are affordable, easy to implement and really effective at decoupling your monitors from your room and all its contents. You’ve gotta get some! Until you do, you’ll never know what your recordings really sound like. MoPAD-XLs are extraordinarily effective AND really versatile. The patented design allows for 5 different positioning options. By using the included MoPAD-XLs Wedge Adjusters, you can adapt your loudspeakers to listening angles of -8°, -4°, 0°, +4° and +8°, as shown below. Use our Room Treatment eXpress (RLX) App to quickly find the best treatment solution for your space!

Its narrow back allows you to twist and reach while its “spine” automatically adjusts to your body’s curve. In forward or reclined positions, the lumbar support stays with you. Having the freedom to move makes your body feel better, improves your blood circulation and sends more oxygen to the brain – all of which help you focus on your work.
• RHYTHM fabric is tight, smooth soft to the touch, and prevents heat buildup

• INNOVATIVE ERGONOMIC DESIGN - More than 20 physicians and PhDs in the fields of biomechanics, vision, physical therapy, and ergonomics contributed their expertise to help guide the development of this chair. As a result, Embody has set a new benchmark for pressure distribution, natural alignment, and support for healthy movement in ergonomic seating.

• BACKFIT ADJUSTMENT - Embody’s back is designed like a human’s, with a central spine and flexible ribs. The Backfit adjustment allows you to position the backrest in line with your spine’s natural curve, so you achieve a neutral, balanced posture. Once the chair is tuned to fit you, the backrest adapts to your movement, adjusting automatically to your shifting positions. Whether you lean forward or recline, support remains constant.

• FEATURES: tilt limiter, adjustable Seat Depth, fully adjustable arms, graphite base and frame, Black arm pads, and carpet casters

• PIXELATED SUPPORT - You feel Embody’s Pixelated Support the moment you sit down—a sense that you are floating, yet perfectly balanced. Thanks to a dynamic matrix of pixels, Embody’s seat and back surfaces automatically conform to your body’s micro-movements, distributing your weight evenly as you sit. This reduces pressure and encourages movement, both of which are key to maintaining healthy circulation and focus.

• LAYERS OF INTELLIGENCE - The Embody seat is comprised of four different support layers—each with its own set of material properties, and each created with a different manufacturing process, all working together, orienting themselves to your shape with a degree of fidelity so high they even accommodate pockets. These layers were designed for airflow, keeping you cool and comfortable as you sit.

• FUNCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY - Form doesn’t just follow function with Embody. Function is on full display. Every part of the chair was designed to serve a very specific, healthful purpose. Embody’s technology isn’t hidden, but is instead part of its aesthetic.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vsHNwGGWL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

That's pretty massive and great for travel but this is just for everyday. I definitely fit everything I need into this backpack. I've tried other bags in the past, different shapes, different layouts. This is the one I always come back to. And as you can tell, it's a little bit different from any of the ones you'll find on their website because it's black with this red stitching. There's some red stitching on the inside here. You can't get that from them. There's also an MKBHD patch at the bottom. It's the MKBHD edition of the bag that only I and some people here at the studio have. Really it's designed to be a photography bag. It has zippers along the side so you can turn it sideways and open it like that if you want to.",,

You've probably most likely already heard of them. They learn your habits. They let you set schedules so it saves energy by not running things as much when you're away and then cooling down or heating up the house for you as you get home. I have this working hand in hand with my solar and battery setup. It is super handy, but also, Nest isn't just a good looking smart home thermostat. It also has Nest Renew, which looks at the cleanliness of the power coming into your home. It helps optimize for pulling the cleanest power anytime you actually do pull from the grid, which for me with solar is a little more rare.",,
