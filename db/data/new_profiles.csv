ANDREW HERE ‚Äì
HOPE YOU‚ÄôRE WELL!

You know my full name at this point and you‚Äôll also know I‚Äôm all about tech, lifestyle and business. But here‚Äôs a little more about me you may not know.

I‚Äôm currently living in sunny Sydney, Australia and have always been a nerd and tech enthusiast at heart, and a digital marketer by trade. 

In my spare time, I‚Äôm busy being a family man, kickboxing junkie, photographer, traveller, investor and casual watch collector.

The one question I get most asked is: what do you do for a living?

I‚Äôm a business owner, content creator, creative and marketer. 

But I find titles unfairly box in people‚Äôs true ability and ambition.

It all started graduating from the University of New South Wales, where I worked across a couple of global marketing firms. 

A few years later, I had worked my way up the corporate ladder as a Senior Marketing Manager earning a 6-figure salary but I was sort of‚Ä¶unfulfilled. 

I genuinely felt I could do more and give more to the world.

Thankfully, the eCommerce store hit it off, and I was able to quit my corporate job in late 2019 ‚Äì months before COVID hit. Yep, great timing.

Fortunately, it‚Äôs worked out far better than I‚Äôd imagine, partnering with awesome companies and consulting multinationals.

To this day, I do not think I‚Äôm particularly talented nor smart. Nothing came intuitively and I did not grow up with a silver spoon in my mouth.

I genuinely believe if I achieved what I have, there‚Äôs no reason you can‚Äôt. So we now teach the skills of digital marketing, eCommerce and content creation through Mastery, our education company.
