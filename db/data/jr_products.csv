He takes a multivitamin to ensure his body is consistently getting the vitamins and minerals it requires. Rogan has been taking Pure Encapsulations Athletic Pure Pack for years as seen in this 2013 Instagram post and as discussed in JRE #802 with Tom Papa (May 2016). Athletic Pure Packs are conveniently separated into daily packets of 9 capsules each. Rogan prefers powdered vitamins in capsule form for better absorption. Athletic Pure Pack is more than just a multivitamin as each packet also contains capsules with BCAAs, ascorbic acid, coenzyme Q10, L-glutamine as well as 900mg of fish oil. He’s a fan of the packets because they’re easy to toss into a backpack to take to the studio or on the road.

It improves immune function, brain function, reduces inflammation and has anti-aging properties. Glutathione repairs and protects cells from damage from free radicals. When glutathione is taken orally, stomach enzymes break most of it down before it’s fully absorbed. A more bioavailable oral version is liposomal glutathione which encapsulates the glutathione in tiny lipid bubbles to protect it from breaking down. The most effective way to increase the body’s glutathione levels is to get an IV infusion of glutathione like Joe Rogan.

https://www.elysiumhealth.com/cdn/shop/files/Basis_Clinical_Trial_Graph_4_1080x.png?v=1660248837","On the recommendation of Dr. Rhonda Patrick, Rogan took a daily anti-aging supplement called Elysium Basis that is available as a monthly subscription. Elysium Basis capsules contain nicotinamide riboside (NR) which the body converts to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), an important molecule found in all living cells that is required for metabolism and DNA repair. An increase in NAD activates the sirtuin genes that regulate aging. NAD levels decline with age – at 50, you have about half as much NAD as at age 20. Dr. Patrick also takes Elysium Basis but stopped while breastfeeding her infant.

Anti-aging expert David Sinclair was a guest on JRE #1234 and he discussed NAD in depth. Sinclair also outlined his own anti-aging supplement regimen as follows:

1g x nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) – morning with yogurt
0.5g x resveratrol powder – morning with yogurt
1g x Metformin – night
NMN is similar to NR and boosts the body’s levels of NAD. Sinclair described NMN as the fuel for sirtuin genes and resveratrol as the gas pedal. Metformin is actually a prescription drug for diabetes but has other benefits like preventing aging, cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimers. Sinclair also supplements with Vitamins D and K2.

Since that podcast, Rogan has been taking resveratrol every morning with his vitamins. He also started taking NMN and says it gives him a lot of energy and makes him feel great.",Visit explorematter.com and use the promo code JRE to get 15% off.,explorematter.com

The DEX places the body in a bent-knee/bent-hip position ideal for targeted decompression in the lower back and hips. Better than a roman chair or bench, this position is also ideal for back extension exercises because it prevents over-extension and neutralizes the hamstrings to isolate the core during strength work. This versatile platform accommodates inverted stretches, core strength building exercises, and use of the base for reverse dips, modified push-ups and exercise band work. FDA Registered to provide traction and stretch the supporting muscles of the spine; indicated for 10 back pain conditions including sciatica, herniated discs and more.

• BETTER THAN ROMAN CHAIR: Ideal for back extension exercises, the horizontal in-use position prevents over-extension and neutralizes the hamstrings to isolate the core during strength work.
• INVERSION TABLE ALTERNATIVE: Hip-supported, forward-rotating decompression targets the lower back and hips with no loads to the ankles.
• COMFORTABLE & ADJUSTABLE: Large lap cushion and oversized leg supports with easy spring-loaded adjustment for multi-user households. Durable polyurethane cane handles and traction grips offer rotation-assist, stretching leverage and exercise grips for dips and push-ups.

I suspect his book will do the same for you.” —Bill Gates A  New York Times  bestseller and international sensation, this “stimulating and important book” ( Financial Times ) is a fascinating dive into the purpose and power of slumber. CBS This Morning  and  Fresh Air 's most popular interview of 2017, Matthew Walker has made abundantly clear that sleep is one of the most important but least understood aspects of our life. Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when it is absent. Compared to the other basic drives in life—eating, drinking, and reproducing—the purpose of sleep remains more elusive. The Sunday Times ) book, preeminent neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker provides a revolutionary exploration of sleep, examining how it affects every aspect of our physical and mental well-being. Charting the most cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, and marshalling his decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood and energy levels, regulate hormones, prevent cancer, Alzheimer’s and diabetes, slow the effects of aging, and increase longevity. He also provides actionable steps towards getting a better night’s sleep every night. Why We Sleep  is a crucial and illuminating book. Written with the precision of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Sherwin Nuland, it is “recommended for night-table reading in the most pragmatic sense” ( The   New York Times Book Review ).

Walker is a sleep scientist and Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. He’s also the Founder and Director of the Center for Human Sleep Science.

Walker’s book Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams goes much more in depth on the benefits of sleep and the negative consequences of poor sleep than he was able to on the podcast. If you liked his episode of the podcast you should also enjoy his book. It will definitely motivate you to follow healthy sleep habits.",,

The ‘recovery’ metric is calculated from monitoring sleep, heart rate variability and resting heart rate compared to a personal baseline. Rogan thought he had been getting longer and better sleep than he actually did according to the sleep tracking. After averaging only 6.03 hrs per night of sleep for that month of October, he realized that he needed to improve his sleep quality, duration and consistency.","Whoop is a heart rate variability and sleep tracker.

It was created by physical therapist and former podcast guest Kelly Starrett (JRE #365). The Supernova 2.0 is used for myofascial release by relaxing contracted muscles and breaking up knots in muscle tissue and the fascia that surrounds it. It also removes scar tissue, promotes circulation and improves flexibility. The textured grooves provide a better grip for a deeper tissue massage.

Joe Rogan has discussed the Supernova 2.0 many times on the podcast. He says he’s a big fan and has several of them scattered all over the studio gym. He always packs one in his luggage when he’s traveling to loosen up his back and shoulder muscles. Rogan prefers the larger Supernova 2.0 (120mm diameter) over the smaller Supernova (80mm diameter).

Standing in front of this device for several minutes allows the red light to penetrate the skin where it is absorbed and converted into cellular energy. The natural health benefits of red light therapy include pain relief, reduced inflammation, improved circulation, faster healing, prevention of delayed onset muscle soreness, and improved sleep. So far Rogan thinks red light therapy makes him feel great but admitted that he does so many things for his health and wellness that it’s hard to attribute that to any one thing.

It features a total of 10 programs to help competitive athletes achieve the highest level of performance. The Endurance Program helps you cope with long-duration aerobic activities and increases muscle resistance to fatigue by building slow-twitch muscle fibers. The Resistance Program is an all-around program for endurance and strength, building both slow and fast-twitch muscle fibers. The Strength Program increases sheer muscle strength better than conventional weight lifting alone, with less risk of muscle-tendon injury. The Explosive Strength Program is for developing short bursts of power without the traumatic or violent movements associated with conventional training. The Potentiation Program warms up muscle faster without psychological, muscular or cardiovascular fatigue. The Active Recovery Program facilitates relaxation of muscles and reduces muscle soreness and stiffness following competition or demanding workouts. The Recovery Plus Program does not contract the muscle. It helps clear lactic acid and increase blood flow at lower frequencies; perfect for muscles that are fatigued after a vigorous workout or competition. The Pre-Warm Up Program does not contract the muscle. It runs at a frequency specifically targeted to increase blood flow to oxygenate the muscles prior to a workout or competition. With the Massage Program, electrostimulation develops the blood capillary network of the exposed muscles. This improves irrigation and oxygenation. The Compex Sport Elite Muscle Stimulator kit includes a carrying case, battery charger, CD with user manual, electrode placement guidebook, and one set of 4 Easy Snap Electrode lead wires. This kit also includes 8 of the 2"" x 2"" Easy Snap Performance Electrodes and 4 of the 2"" x 4"" Easy Snap Performance Electrodes.

Compex Muscle Stimulators cause muscle contractions by sending electrical signals to electrode pads placed on a target body part. They come with various pre-programmed treatments including programs for recovery, massage and relaxation. These programs create muscle twitches at low frequency to increase blood flow, flush out lactic acid, promote muscle relaxation and prevent delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). This allows you to recover faster than simply resting. Compex devices even have a TENS program for pain relief.",,

Kombucha lovers drink Health-Ade not only for the great-tasting flavors, but also as an alternative to sodas, coffee, teas, and even sparkling water for a refreshing beverage that is organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, vegan, and kosher. Health-Ade Kombucha is sold in bulk 12-packs & 6-packs of 16oz glass bottles (select flavors), as well as 12-packs of 11.5oz cans.

From there, we flavor with different notes of fruity and tangy, using cold pressed juices, to deliver a beautiful kombucha tea.
• CLEAR THE BAD, ADD THE GOOD! The fermentation process produces healthy acids like acetic, lactic, gluconic, and glucuronic acid. These acids clear out the icky stuff in your gut and reduce inflammation, balance energy levels, and cultivate a happier, healthier you!
• SHIPS TO 48 STATES! We’ve done rigorous testing to make sure the specific probiotics and delicious goodness in Health-Ade Kombucha can survive every shipping option, even without refrigeration.

At the new JRE Austin studio, Joe Rogan is still using the Shure SM7B Vocal Dynamic Microphone which is popular with top podcasters and professional broadcasters. It was designed for speech but works equally well for music vocals. The sound is natural and warm with flat, wide-range frequency response. Sound quality is comparable to more expensive microphones. It is meant to be used within a few inches of your face which is why you’ll hear Rogan constantly remind guests to keep it close to their mouth. A decent mixer or mic preamp is required due to the low output level. The Shure SM7B comes with two foam windscreens to reduce P-pops. It rejects electromagnetic hum by shielding against the interference generated by electrical devices. An internal shockmount reduces vibrations from the microphone arm and from touching the mic.

Other popular podcasts that use Shure SM7B microphones include The Fighter and The Kid with Bryan Callen and Brendan Schaub, This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von, WTF Podcast with Marc Maron, and Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard.",,

XENYX USB Series mixers are designed to handle your live gigs, and they provide the state-of-the-art tools you need to make stunning, professional-quality recordings. Along with their built-in USB/audio interfaces, XENYX USB mixers come with all the recording and editing software you'll need to turn your computer system into a complete, high-performance home recording studio. Sonically Superior Mic Preamps All XENYX mixers have one thing in common - great-sounding, high headroom XENYX mic preamps. These state-of-the-art mic pres represent a major step in the evolution of audio technology - and they can easily hold their own, even when compared to the most expensive stand-alone mic preamps. XENYX preamps offer a staggering 130 dB of dynamic range, with a bandwidth that extends from below 10 Hz to well above 200 kHz. Armed with these outstanding mic preamps, XENYX mixers provide such transparent, crystal-clear performance you just might think someone upgraded your mics while you weren't looking. Sublimely Musical British EQ The British consoles of the 1960s and '70s changed the sound of rock and roll - without them the British Invasion might not have happened. Those legendary mixing desks soon became the envy of engineers and producers all over the world. The channel EQ on our XENYX mixers is based on that very same circuitry, allowing you to imbue signals with incredible warmth and detailed musical character. Even when applied generously, these equalizers exhibit sweet forgiveness and superb audio quality. One-Knob Compression Ask professional sound engineers what their favorite piece of external processing gear is and the majority response will be virtually unanimous - dynamic compression. What is compression? We're glad you asked. Compression essentially limits the dynamic range of a signal, lowering the level of loud sounds and turning up softer sounds, to achieve sonic balance. But applying compression is a delicate art that many novice, and even intermediate, sound techs have great difficulty mastering. Our ""one-knob"" compression is available on all mono channels and is easy to operate, even for entry-level users. With this one knob, you can easily dial in the perfect amount of compression for instruments and vocals, creating powerful mixes with punch and clarity. This is indeed a rare feature for products in this class - but standard on all XENYX USB mixers. Effective FX All XENYX USB Series mixers (except the 1204USB) feature our new 24-bit dual engine FX processor, with 16 editable, studio-grade presets including reverb, chorus, flanger, delay, pitch shifter and multi-effects. Complete with a highly accurate input meter, these effects can be altered to your personal taste via the Parameter control. Time-based functions can be entered manually by pressing the Tap button in tempo with the music. Recording Bliss There was a time when the recording process called for lots and lots of expensive gear, which meant the average musician had to buy time at a recording studio - and that time was pricey indeed. But modern technology has put personal recording well within the reach of virtually anyone with access to a computer. How do you get all that music flying around your brain into your computer? That's where XENYX USB mixers come in. Thanks to the built-in, bi-directional stereo USB audio interface, you can connect any of these mixers directly to your PC or Mac computer via a single USB cable. Now any signal source you connect to the mixer can be recorded directly to your hard drive. Which brings us to software. Free Would Be Nice! Because you'll want to take full advantage of the XENYX USB Series mixers' recording and podcasting potential, we've thrown in a massive software package that includes Audacity (the most popular open source audio editor), Podifier, Juice, Podnova and Golden Ear (a great selection of podcasting software). You're ready to go live on your PC or Mac computer right out of the box! You also get more than 100 virtual instruments and 50 FX plug-ins, turning your computer into a complete home-based or mobile recording studio from input to output.

The result is that points of light in out-of-focus areas, usually the background of your shot, are beautifully circularly blurred, creating an authentic and artistic feel. The professional touch of a manual focus ring allows accurate and precise control. For extra flexibility, the manual focus ring can be easily set to control zoom instead.    New, Advanced HD CMOS Pro Image Sensor with Improved Low-light Performance New, Advanced HD CMOS Pro Image Sensor For incredibly sharp and detailed high-definition video recording, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder features a reengineered, 1/2.84-inch, 2.91 Megapixel HD CMOS Pro Image Sensor that captures approximately 2136 x 1362 pixels. Thanks to the sensor's enhanced sensitivity, the VIXIA HF G40 helps provide vivid, accurate recording through an improved signal-to-noise ratio. Improved Low-light Performance Featuring an improved, low-luminance noise rating of +3 dB, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder is able to capture clearer, sharper images in lower light, with even better detail.    1080/60p Recording in MP4 1080/60p Recording in MP4 The VIXIA HF G40 camcorder gives you high-quality recording whether you're capturing MP4 or AVCHD files. 1080/60p recording captures twice the amount of information as 60i, and with images captured at a rate of up to 60 frames per second, diagonal noise is virtually eliminated so even fast moving subjects show up crisply with motion and patterns clearly recorded. This greater sense of detail and faithful rendering of moving edges, plus enhanced color and fine tonal gradation, gives your video everything Full HD has to offer. With the VIXIA HF G40 you can record in internet-ready, easy-to-share MP4 format at up to 35 Mbps. The VIXIA HF G40 also features a maximum bit rate of 28 Mbps for AVCHD recording, the highest in the AVCHD standard. So, regardless of the format you're shooting or viewing, image quality is outstanding. Native 24p Progressive Mode The VIXIA HF G40 camcorder features the Native 24p Progressive Mode, which allows up to 24 frames per second to be captured and recorded (instead of the standard 60i) – a look that is evocative of traditional cinematic quality, and a must for serious filmmaking work.    Built-in Wi-Fi Technology with FTP Transfer Capability Click here for larger image Built-in, dual-band (5 GHz/2.4 GHz) Wi-Fi technology on the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder lets you share your HD video easily, and in a number of different ways.

Superb Image Reproduction The VIXIA HF G40 camcorder represents Canon's Full HD System, delivering truly excellent image quality and reproduction for most any application. With its 20x Optical Zoom HD Video lens, its new HD CMOS Pro Image Sensor and the powerful DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor working together to capture and process the images at hand, the VIXIA HF G40 is positioned to deliver HD video that is nothing short of stunning.    3.5-inch OLED Viewscreen with 10,000:1 Contrast Ratio and EVF 3.5-inch OLED Viewscreen with 10,000:1 Contrast Ratio The touch-sensitive Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) panel on the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder boasts an impressive viewing angle, color reproduction, contrast and touch responsiveness. Your vivid, clear video will be reproduced faithfully with approximately 1.23 million dots of resolution. And the touch responsiveness of the screen is smooth and sensitive, enabling fluid control of camera functions like Touch & Track, Touch Focus and Touch Exposure. Electronic Viewfinder The VIXIA HF G40 features a 0.24-inch, approximately 1.56 million-dot color electronic viewfinder with approximately 100% field of view coverage for detailed, accurate composition judgment. The viewfinder can be tilted up to 45° from its normal resting position to enable a great amount of shooting freedom. Settings can be adjusted with a handy joystick so you don't have to stop looking through the viewfinder. And, because it is positioned where your thumb naturally rests while holding the camera, you can shoot and adjust easily – even with one hand!    Dual SD Card Slots, Using Readily Available, Consumable Media The VIXIA HF G40 camcorder allows you to record video directly to widely available SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards with capacities ranging from over 32GB to 2TB.

Dual and Relay Recording Dual Recording Dual Recording and built-in transcoding help ensure that you'll have the right format available for your needs. Using the power of the DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder can simultaneously record video in AVCHD format to one SD card, and in MP4 format to the other SD card^. The widely used MP4 format provides quick, conversion-free playback on compatible tablets and smartphones, and lets you upload videos directly to select social networking sites for easy sharing with friends, family and the world. AVCHD is ideal for watching videos on an HDTV or archiving them to Blu-ray discs. The camcorder also has a built-in transcoding function that converts AVCHD files to MP4s, making them easy to upload to the Web or save to an SD card.

Relay Recording Dual slots on the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder enable Relay Recording. The camcorder automatically switches to the second memory card when the first becomes full, so there's no need to worry about running out of recording time during a thrilling, once-in-a-lifetime shot.    Wide DR Gamma (600%) For natural and realistic-looking image capture that faithfully represents the scene at hand, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder features a Wide DR Gamma mode. By suppressing overexposure in high brightness areas of the composition, this mode helps achieve a wide dynamic range of 600% to produce virtually seamless tone gradations, resulting in smooth detail, accurate color and virtually no blown-out highlights.    Highlight Priority Mode To capture highly saturated, realistic colors and to convey gradation characteristics as perceived by the eye, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder has a new Highlight Priority mode that achieves effects similar to HDR modes in other camcorders. By reducing the mid- to high-brightness compression of the standard gamma mode, the Highlight Priority mode helps to prevent loss of detail in high brightness areas. Designed for display on a bright LCD TV, videos captured in Highlight Priority mode should be shown at a high brightness setting to help ensure accurate portrayal of the effect.    View Assist Function that Supports Highlight Priority Mode When using the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder in Highlight Priority mode, the View Assist function increases brightness and medium tone gamma in the camera's viewfinder or OLED panel. This allows images to be displayed with the brightness and gradation with which they are being recorded or reviewed, helping to ensure the subjects look natural and realistic.    Intelligent Optical Image Stabilization System with Powered and Dynamic Modes and Auto On/Off Canon's sophisticated SuperRange Optical Image Stabilizer corrects camera shake instantly, so even handheld video taken at long focal lengths can be sharp and steady. The power of Canon's DIGIC DV 4 Image Processor has made possible a versatile Dynamic Image Stabilization mode. In addition to providing continuous adjustment throughout the entire zoom range to correct a broad range of motion, with extra compensation applied at wide-angle focal lengths, the system stabilizes rotational camera shake. Controlling rotational camera shake – horizontal, vertical and roll axis – helps ensure smooth, virtually distortion-free video, even when you're walking while shooting.    Full Manual Control Custom Key and Dial A Custom Key and Dial feature allows you to assign functions to an easily accessible key and adjust the settings with a control dial. The functions include:  Tv/Av: Use the dial to adjust shutter speed (Tv mode) or aperture (Av mode), as needed. In this mode the key has no effect.  Manual exposure: When manual control is selected, the dial can adjust aperture, shutter speed or gain. Select items to adjust, such as aperture or other settings, with the key.  Exposure Lock can be set on or off as can the AGC Limit. Composition Aids With the Level Marker feature, it's easy to keep the camcorder level for more accurate framing. The Grid Marker provides a reference grid in your viewfinder. Depending on the background color of your shot, you can choose between two different colors (white or gray) for better viewing contrast. Gain Control Gain may be manually set from 0 dB to 24 dB in 1 dB increments. Additionally, Auto Gain Control Limit allows you to set the maximum gain limit for the image sensor's sensitivity. With this function, brightness and noise can be balanced as required, and image quality can be maximized in low-light situations. Power Zoom Power zoom is available in Variable and Constant settings in 3 modes: Fast (approx. 1.9–60 seconds), Normal (approx. 2.5–180 seconds) and Slow (approx. 4.0–285 seconds). To provide added control, there are 16 predefined steps in Constant mode.    Ergonomic, Portable Design Weighing approximately two pounds including the battery and lens hood, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder is ideal for high-action shoots when both speed and mobility are essential, and where keeping a low profile is an added benefit. Though small in size, this camcorder sacrifices nothing when it comes to professional functionality. It features a “seesaw” style zoom lever, manual focus/zoom ring and joystick for easy control and an electronic viewfinder that can tilt up to 45° for low-angle shooting. It also has five Assign Buttons to help it fit to your operational needs.    High Definition Peaking for Focus Assist To enhance focusing capability, the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder provides Focus Assist. It includes enlargement, which helps in capturing your subject in razor-sharp focus. It works by providing a 2x magnification of your subject, which is automatically cancelled when you start recording. Also included is color peaking, which shows the shooting object's focused areas in actual colors.    Assignable Buttons for Custom Shooting The VIXIA HF G40 camcorder is equipped with five assignable buttons so that the camcorder can be tailored to the specific preferences or needs of the user.    Connectivity to Various Inputs and Outputs Not only does the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder provide the user with incredible control over the image, it also provides immense creative freedom when it comes to inputs and outputs, including:   HDMI Output (HDMI mini connector, time code can be superimposed)  Composite Video Output (3.5mm)  USB Hi-Speed Terminal  Microphone Input (3.5mm)  Headphone Jack (3.5mm)  Remote Control Terminal (compatible with LANC protocol)  Mini Advanced Accessory Shoe    High-capacity Battery Included The VIXIA HF G40 camcorder is powered by a high-capacity battery pack. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery not only lets you shoot for a long time, but features intelligent technology that accurately indicates remaining battery time for extra insurance that you won't miss an important shooting opportunity.    Linear PCM Audio Recording2 and Audio Scene Select Linear PCM Audio Recording2 Professional-quality 16-bit PCM* recordings offer enhanced sound quality and fidelity and are fully compatible with video- and audio-editing software.  Audio Scene Select Audio Scene Select offers five modes and one custom mode that automatically optimize settings based on the recording situation, making it easy to record realistic, immersive audio in a range of situations.    Compatible with Optional Canon WM-V1 Wireless Microphone Canon helps you get more out of your camcorder with a range of optional accessories that inspire creativity and productivity. One such example is the Canon WM-V1 Wireless Microphone, which streams audio wirelessly from subjects up to 164 feet away. It can be ideal for adding your subject's voice at times when you can't get in close to shoot, and can also be used as a stand-alone transceiver to cue shooting and more.    Mini Advanced Accessory Shoe The Mini Advanced Accessory Shoe allows you to attach optional Canon accessories, such as the Video Light VL-5, Directional Stereo Microphone DM-100 or 5.1-Channel Surround Microphone SM-V1.    Advanced Display Features: Zebra, Color Bars and Test Tone Videographers with exacting needs will appreciate the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder's range of functions designed to pinpoint focus adjustment and exposure control while helping you get professional-level quality from the camcorder. Zebra pattern indicates “blown out” or high brightness areas to help you set proper exposure. Color bars and test tone can be selected and recorded in order to adjust video and audio quality.    Slow and Fast Motion, including Interval Recording from 2x to 1200x Slow and Fast Motion Modes allow the VIXIA HF G40 camcorder to record a different frame rate than the playback frame rate (only in MP4 recording modes), for a fast or slow motion effect during playback. Since the camcorder is recording real frames and modifying the playback rate, there is virtually no quality loss and maximum image quality is maintained. Additionally, interval recording allows the user to record frames at specified intervals, providing time-lapse recording of up to 1200x and slow motion down to 0.4x of the original speed.

In Episode #854 with Louie Simmons and #965 with Robert Sapolsky, Joe Rogan can be seen using the the Blue Yeti USB Microphone. USB microphones include a built-in preamp and an analog-to-digital converter which means you don’t need any additional podcasting equipment besides a computer to connect it to.

Why, as a species, are humans so fascinated by altered states of consciousness? Can altered states reveal something to us about our origins and our place in nature? In  Food of the Gods , ethnobotanist Terence McKenna’s research on man’s ancient relationship with chemicals opens a doorway to the divine, and perhaps a solution for saving our troubled world. McKenna provides a revisionist look at the historical role of drugs in the East and the West, from ancient spice, sugar, and rum trades to marijuana, cocaine, synthetics, and even television—illustrating the human desire for the “food of the gods” and the powerful potential to replace abuse of illegal drugs with a shamanic understanding, insistence on community, reverence for nature, and increased self-awareness.

His answer was Food of the Gods by Terence McKenna (you can listen to his complete answer below). McKenna was an ethnobotanist and psychonaut who greatly influenced Rogan’s views on psychedelics and consciousness. In Food of the Gods, he explores the role that plants, drugs and altered states of consciousness have played throughout human history. Fans of the podcast are no doubt familiar with the ‘stoned ape theory’ linking human evolution with the use of psilocybin mushrooms, which McKenna proposes in the book. His underlying message is that humans need to revive their historical relationship with psychoactive plants in order to avoid destroying the planet and themselves.",,

Using tools as varied as archaeo-astronomy, geology, and computer analysis of ancient myths, Graham Hancock presents a compelling case to suggest that it is.   Graham Hancock is featured in  Ancient Apocalypse,  a Netflix original docuseries. “A fancy piece of historical sleuthing . . . intriguing and entertaining and sturdy enough to give a long pause for thought.”— Kirkus Reviews Fingerprints of the Gods,  Hancock embarks on a worldwide quest to put together all the pieces of the vast and fascinating jigsaw of mankind’s hidden past. In ancient monuments as far apart as Egypt’s Great Sphinx, the strange Andean ruins of Tihuanaco, and Mexico’s awe-inspiring Temples of the Sun and Moon, he reveals not only the clear fingerprints of an as-yet-unidentified civilization of remote antiquity, but also startling evidence of its vast sophistication, technological advancement, and evolved scientific knowledge. Fingerprints of the Gods  contains the makings of an intellectual revolution, a dramatic and irreversible change in the way that we understand our past—and so our future. Fingerprints of God  tells us something more. As we recover the truth about prehistory, and discover the real meaning of ancient myths and monuments, it becomes apparent that a warning has been handed down to us, a warning of terrible cataclysm that afflicts the Earth in great cycles at irregular intervals of time—a cataclysm that may be about to recur. “Readers will hugely enjoy their quest in these pages of inspired storytelling.”— The Times  (UK)      Read more

In Fingerprints of the Gods, Hancock theorizes that a previously unknown ancient civilization was much older and far more advanced than we’ve been led to believe was possible. A cataclysmic event erased them from history and a few survivors traveled the world to spread their knowledge to civilizations in Egypt and the Americas. Recounting his extensive travels to megalithic sites, Hancock attempts to solve this mystery using maps, ancient myths and astronomy. Recent discoveries continue to move back the timeline of ancient history. If you enjoyed this book, check out the sequel Magicians of the Gods, released 20 years after the original.

In the  Madre de Dios —Mother of God—region of Peru, where the Amazon River begins its massive flow, the Andean Mountain cloud forests fall into lowland Amazon Rainforest, creating the most biodiversity-rich place on the planet. In January 2006, when he was just a restless eighteen-year-old hungry for adventure, Paul Rosolie embarked on a journey to the west Amazon that would transform his life. Venturing alone into some of the most inaccessible reaches of the jungle, he encountered giant snakes, floating forests, isolated tribes untouched by outsiders, prowling jaguars, orphaned baby anteaters, poachers in the black market trade in endangered species, and much more. Yet today, the primordial forests of the Madre de Dios are in danger from developers, oil giants, and gold miners eager to exploit its natural resources. In  Mother of God , this explorer and conservationist relives his amazing odyssey exploring the heart of this wildest place on earth. When he began delving deeper in his search for the secret Eden, spending extended periods in isolated solitude, he found things he never imagined could exist. “Alone and miniscule against a titanic landscape I have seen the depths of the Amazon, the guts of the jungle where no men go, Rosolie writes. “But as the legendary explorer Percy Fawcett warned, ‘the few remaining unknown places of the world exact a price for their secrets.’” Illustrated with 16 pages of color photos.

For generations of Americans, our country has been the world's dominant military power. How the US military fights, and the systems and weapons that it fights with, have been uncontested. That old reality, however, is rapidly deteriorating. America's traditional sources of power are eroding amid the emergence of new technologies and the growing military threat posed by rivals such as China.

China has concentration camps  now . Why do Westerners claim our sins are unique? It is now in vogue to celebrate non-Western cultures and disparage Western ones. Some of this is a much-needed reckoning, but much of it fatally undermines the very things that created the greatest, most humane civilization in the world. In  The War on the West , Douglas Murray shows how many well-meaning people have been fooled by hypocritical and inconsistent anti-West rhetoric. After all, if we must discard the ideas of Kant, Hume, and Mill for their opinions on race, shouldn’t we discard Marx, whose work is peppered with racial slurs and anti-Semitism? Embers of racism remain to be stamped out in America, but what about the raging racist inferno in the Middle East and Asia? It’s not just dishonest scholars who benefit from this intellectual fraud but hostile nations and human rights abusers hoping to distract from their own ongoing villainy. Dictators who slaughter their own people are happy to jump on the “America is a racist country” bandwagon and mimic the language of antiracism and “pro-justice” movements as PR while making authoritarian conquests. If the West is to survive, it must be defended. The War on the West  is not only an incisive takedown of foolish anti-Western arguments but also a rigorous new apologetic for civilization itself.      Read more

NEW YORK TIMES  BESTSELLER  Yuval Noah Harari, author of the critically-acclaimed  New York Times  bestseller and international phenomenon  Sapiens , returns with an equally original, compelling, and provocative book, turning his focus toward humanity’s future, and our quest to upgrade humans into gods. Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough, yet riveting—famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda. What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake?  Homo Deus  explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus. With the same insight and clarity that made  Sapiens  an international hit and a  New York Times  bestseller, Harari maps out our future.       Read more

A groundbreaking dive into the role psychedelics have played in the origins of Western civilization, and the real-life quest for the Holy Grail that could shake the Church to its foundations.  The most influential religious historian of the 20th century, Huston Smith, once referred to it as the ""best-kept secret"" in history. Did the Ancient Greeks use drugs to find God? And did the earliest Christians inherit the same, secret tradition? A profound knowledge of visionary plants, herbs and fungi passed from one generation to the next, ever since the Stone Age? There is zero archaeological evidence for the original Eucharist – the sacred wine said to guarantee life after death for those who drink the blood of Jesus. The Holy Grail and its miraculous contents have never been found. In the absence of any hard data, whatever happened at the Last Supper remains an article of faith for today’s 2.5 billion Christians. In an unprecedented search for real answers,  The Immortality Key  examines the archaic roots of the ritual that is performed every Sunday for nearly one third of the planet. Religion and science converge to paint a radical picture of Christianity’s founding event. And after centuries of debate, to solve history’s greatest puzzle once and for all. Before the birth of Jesus, the Ancient Greeks found salvation in their own sacraments. Sacred beverages were routinely consumed as part of the so-called Ancient Mysteries – elaborate rites that led initiates to the brink of death. The best and brightest from Athens and Rome flocked to the spiritual capital of Eleusis, where a holy beer unleashed heavenly visions for two thousand years. Others drank the holy wine of Dionysus to become one with the god. In the 1970s, renegade scholars claimed this beer and wine – the original sacraments of Western civilization – were spiked with mind-altering drugs. In recent years, vindication for the disgraced theory has been quietly mounting in the laboratory. The constantly advancing fields of archaeobotany and archaeochemistry have hinted at the enduring use of hallucinogenic drinks in antiquity. And with a single dose of psilocybin, the psychopharmacologists at Johns Hopkins and NYU are now turning self-proclaimed atheists into instant believers. But the smoking gun remains elusive. If these sacraments survived for thousands of years in our remote prehistory, from the Stone Age to the Ancient Greeks, did they also survive into the age of Jesus? Was the Eucharist of the earliest Christians, in fact, a psychedelic Eucharist? With an unquenchable thirst for evidence, Muraresku takes the reader on his twelve-year global hunt for proof. He tours the ruins of Greece with its government archaeologists. He gains access to the hidden collections of the Louvre Museum to show the continuity from pagan to Christian wine. He unravels the Ancient Greek of the New Testament with the world’s most controversial priest. He spelunks into the catacombs under the streets of Rome to decipher the lost symbols of Christianity’s oldest monuments. He breaches the secret archives of the Vatican to unearth manuscripts never before translated into English. And with leads from the archaeological chemists at the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he unveils the first scientific data for the ritual use of psychedelic drugs in classical antiquity. The Immortality Key  reconstructs the suppressed history of women consecrating a forbidden, drugged Eucharist that was later banned by the Church Fathers. Women who were then targeted as witches during the Inquisition, when Europe’s sacred pharmacology largely disappeared. If the scientists of today have resurrected this technology, then Christianity is in crisis. Unless it returns to its roots.

But unlike rabies, the disease has a terrifyingly short incubation period of an hour or less. Those infected quickly lose their minds and are driven to bite and infect as many others as they can before they inevitably succumb. Hospitals are inundated with the sick and dying, and hysteria has taken hold. To try to limit its spread, the commonwealth is under quarantine and curfew. But society is breaking down and the government's emergency protocols are faltering. Dr. Ramola ""Rams"" Sherman, a soft-spoken pediatrician in her mid-thirties, receives a frantic phone call from Natalie, a friend who is eight months pregnant. Natalie's husband has been killed—viciously attacked by an infected neighbor—and in a failed attempt to save him, Natalie, too, was bitten. Natalie's only chance of survival is to get to a hospital as quickly as possible to receive a rabies vaccine. The clock is ticking for her and for her unborn child. Natalie’s fight for life becomes a desperate odyssey as she and Rams make their way through a hostile landscape filled with dangers beyond their worst nightmares—terrifying, strange, and sometimes deadly challenges that push them to the brink.  Paul Tremblay once again demonstrates his mastery in this chilling and all-too-plausible novel that will leave readers racing through the pages . . . and shake them to their core.

Over the past decade, Silicon Valley executives like Eric Schmidt and Elon Musk, Special Operators like the Navy SEALs and the Green Berets, and maverick scientists like Sasha Shulgin and Amy Cuddy have turned everything we thought we knew about high performance upside down. Instead of grit, better habits, or 10,000 hours, these trailblazers have found a surprising short cut. They're harnessing rare and controversial states of consciousness to solve critical challenges and outperform the competition.  New York Times  bestselling author Steven Kotler and high performance expert Jamie Wheal spent four years investigating the leading edges of this revolution—from the home of SEAL Team Six to the Googleplex, the Burning Man festival, Richard Branson’s Necker Island, Red Bull’s training center, Nike’s innovation team, and the United Nations’ Headquarters. And what they learned was stunning: In their own ways, with differing languages, techniques, and applications, every one of these groups has been quietly seeking the same thing: the boost in information and inspiration that altered states provide.  Today, this revolution is spreading to the mainstream, fueling a  trillion  dollar underground economy and forcing us to rethink how we can all lead richer, more productive, more satisfying lives. Driven by four accelerating forces—psychology, neurobiology, technology and pharmacology—we are gaining access to and insights about some of the most contested and misunderstood terrain in history. Stealing Fire is a provocative examination of what’s actually possible; a guidebook for anyone who wants to radically upgrade their life.      Read more

It's Grown. Here's How,8.99,"What is the secret of talent? How do we unlock it? In this groundbreaking work, journalist and New York Times bestselling author Daniel Coyle provides parents, teachers, coaches, businesspeople—and everyone else—with tools they can use to maximize potential in themselves and others.

Whether you’re coaching soccer or teaching a child to play the piano, writing a novel or trying to improve your golf swing, this revolutionary book shows you how to grow talent by tapping into a newly discovered brain mechanism.

Drawing on cutting-edge neurology and firsthand research gathered on journeys to nine of the world’s talent hotbeds—from the baseball fields of the Caribbean to a classical-music academy in upstate New York—Coyle identifies the three key elements that will allow you to develop your gifts and optimize your performance in sports, art, music, math, or just about anything.

• Deep Practice--Everyone knows that practice is a key to success. What everyone doesn’t know is that specific kinds of practice can increase skill up to ten times faster than conventional practice.

• Ignition--We all need a little motivation to get started. But what separates truly high achievers from the rest of the pack? A higher level of commitment—call it passion—born out of our deepest unconscious desires and triggered by certain primal cues. Understanding how these signals work can help you ignite passion and catalyze skill development.

• Master Coaching--What are the secrets of the world’s most effective teachers, trainers, and coaches? Discover the four virtues that enable these “talent whisperers” to fuel passion, inspire deep practice, and bring out the best in their students.

These three elements work together within your brain to form myelin, a microscopic neural substance that adds vast amounts of speed and accuracy to your movements and thoughts. Scientists have discovered that myelin might just be the holy grail: the foundation of all forms of greatness, from Michelangelo’s to Michael Jordan’s. The good news about myelin is that it isn’t fixed at birth; to the contrary, it grows, and like anything that grows, it can be cultivated and nourished.

New York Times  Bestseller A Summer Reading Pick for President Barack Obama, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg  From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.” One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires,  Sapiens  integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.

Easwaran's 55-page introduction places the Bhagavad Gita in its historical setting, and brings out the universality and timelessness of its teachings. Chapter introductions clarify key concepts, and notes and a glossary explain Sanskrit terms. Easwaran grew up in the Hindu tradition in India, and learned Sanskrit from a young age. He was a professor of English literature before coming to the West on a Fulbright scholarship. A gifted teacher, he is recognized as an authority on the Indian classics and world mysticism. The Bhagavad Gita opens, dramatically, on a battlefield, as the warrior Arjuna turns in anguish to his spiritual guide, Sri Krishna, for answers to the fundamental questions of life. Yet, as Easwaran points out, the Gita is not what it seems – it’s not a dialogue between two mythical figures at the dawn of Indian history. “The battlefield is a perfect backdrop, but the Gita’s subject is the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious.” Arjuna’s struggle in the Bhagavad Gita is acutely modern. He has lost his way on the battlefield of life and turns to find the path again by asking direct, uncompromising questions of his spiritual guide, Sri Krishna, the Lord himself. Krishna replies in 700 verses of sublime instruction on living and dying, loving and working, and the nature of the soul. Easwaran shows the Gita’s relevance to us today as we strive, like Arjuna, to do what is right. “No one in modern times is more qualified – no, make that ‘as qualified’ – to translate the epochal Classics of Indian Spirituality than Eknath Easwaran. And the reason is clear. It is impossible to get to the heart of those classics unless you live them, and he did live them.

Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires,  Sapiens  integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

The story begins 13,000 years ago, when Stone Age hunter-gatherers constituted the entire human population. Around that time, the developmental paths of human societies on different continents began to diverge greatly. Early domestication of wild plants and animals in the Fertile Crescent, China, Mesoamerica, the Andes, and other areas gave peoples of those regions a head start at a new way of life.

The unequal rates at which food production spread from those initial centers were influenced by other features of climate and geography, including the disparate sizes, locations, and even shapes of the continents. Only societies that moved away from the hunter-gatherer stage went on to develop writing, technology, government, and organized religions as well as deadly germs and potent weapons of war.
