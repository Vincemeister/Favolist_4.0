Andrew Ethan Zeng,The MODERN Desk Setup 2023 ,"After years of optimizing and investing my desk setup, this is finally my modern desk setup for 2023 that I’m happy with! In this video, I go over the entire planning and ethos for this space and give you a full tour of the desk and entire office and studio setup and everything that has gone into it. I hope you enjoy it and take ideas for your own setups! Setup Makeover Episode 03 // Thank you for monday.com for sponsoring this video.

The ethos for this setup I think can be nicely summed up by one of my all-time favorite quotes by Leonardo da Vinci Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. It's a space with a simple color palette, simple textures aesthetically and practically. I want my workspace to look and work as a studio, office, and living space that has multiple forms and functions, a space that positively impacts my well-being and allows my productivity and creativity to flow.
