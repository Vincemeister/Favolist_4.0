Marques Brownlee,Desk Tour 2023,"My setup tour and everyday carry for 2023. Check out the video here (I seperated the every day carry into another list on Favolist): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A18BST27Wpw

Hi, what's up guys, MKBHD here. I've decided to do another desk tour. Many have inquired about the new setup, commenting, ""It's 2023, you haven't done an update yet."" To me, most things feel the same, having used this setup for a long time. But, on reflection, some elements have changed, and I can guide you through them. It speaks volumes about the items that have endured, especially those present.

Marques Brownlee,My Everyday Tech 2023,"I did two videos on the stuff I have in my bag and carry around literally every day. One is from 2022, and one from 2023, and nothing much changed. This list contains all the products I carry in my bag.

Check out the video of my desk tour and everyday carry for 2023 (it also contains my desk setup, but I have a different list on Favolist for that): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A18BST27Wpw
