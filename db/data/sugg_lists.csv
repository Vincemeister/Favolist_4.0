Andrew Huberman,Foundational Supplements,"“Does Andrew Huberman take NMN?” This is the question everyone has been asking, and Andrew has remained quiet about whether he was taking this “miracle” anti-aging supplement made famous by Dr. David Sinclair. Well, we finally have an answer.

In a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, Huberman reveals he takes 1 gram of Renue by Science NMN sublingually.

NMN, short for nicotinamide mononucleotide, is a molecule that our bodies make naturally, which converts to NAD+. NAD+ regulates DNA repair, energy metabolism, gene expression, and cellular stress responses. As it naturally decreases as we age, Dr. David Sinclair of Harvard recommends supplementing with 500-1000 grams of NMN daily.

As of March 2023, the FDA has been cracking down on the sale of NMN as a dietary supplement. Many companies like Amazon have been removing NMN from their shelves. Renue by Science is a pioneer in bringing NMN to the market and is still carrying it on its website. Huberman takes NMN sublingually – meaning under his tongue – every single morning."

Andrew Huberman,Focus & Cognition Supplements,"How do we improve the quality of our sleep? How do we maintain our testosterone levels as we get older? How do we keep focus and attention when life can be so exhausting and simultaneously pull you in a million different directions? How do we keep our stress under control? Most people have these questions, and it can be challenging to sort out the excellent information from the bad when searching for answers.

If you listen to Joe Rogan’s top-rated podcast, you may have heard a fascinating episode with Dr. Andrew Huberman, who has these same questions and tried to answer them himself. Since then, Huberman’s own podcast has since blown up. It has sparked a lot of interest in Dr. Huberman’s background, research, and his own personal supplement regimen for maximum mental health, physical health, and performance."
Andrew Huberman,Hormone Support Supplements,"As we age, men can start to feel less like “themselves.” This can be due to dropping testosterone levels. Andrew extols the importance of maintaining healthy testosterone levels in the body. That being said, he is a big believer in ensuring proper sleep, regular exercise, a healthy diet, and the avoidance of chronic stress are all in place before seeking supplements to increase testosterone levels.

Optimizing your hormones is a critical aspect of mental health, physical health, and performance. When it is time to look into supplements to increase testosterone, Tongkat Ali and Fadogia Agrestis have done well for him as part of his personal regimen. Momentous also sells the Huberman Lab Hormone Support bundle (remember code ‘brainflow’ for 15% off!)

Andrew Huberman,Supplements For Improving Sleep Quality,"""Dr. Andrew Huberman is a world-renowned neuroscientist and tenured professor at Stanford University. His podcast Huberman Lab has exploded over the last year due to his expertise in optimizing health. His podcast about his sleep supplement stack has become famous among health nuts due to its success in helping people fall asleep, stay asleep, and spend longer in REM sleep without taking prescription medication.

According to estimates, 50 to 70 million people in the United States struggle with sleep. Even more disturbing, more than one-third of adults in the United States do not get 7 hours of sleep per night – the bare minimum needed to function the next day. Good sleep hygiene not only helps us feel better during the day but also helps us live longer."""

Andrew Huberman,Tracking & Measuring Health,"Andrew tests his blood twice a year to track and monitor his health. He finds that by doing this, he can adequately determine what supplements do to his body. One example is when he took Tongkat Ali and Fadogia Agretis for a testosterone boost. Before adding these supplements to his regimen, Andrew already had a baseline reading from his prior blood tests. After taking the supplements, he could adequately test their effects on his system from his next blood test.

One company that Andrew endorses for blood tests that he has specifically endorsed on his podcast is Inside Tracker. Inside Tracker was founded in 2009 by experts in biometric data, genetics, and aging. These experts come from heralded academic institutions like MIT, Harvard, and Tufts. The algorithm that drives Inside Tracker’s platform is constantly being further refined and developed. Whenever there are further cutting-edge advances in the field, Inside Tracker is known to be at the forefront of them."
Andrew Huberman,Sponsors of the Huberman Lab Podcast,"The Huberman Lab podcast has worked with a select group of sponsors since our launch in January 2021. These relationships allow for ongoing production of the podcast and allow it to be zero-cost to anyone who wishes to listen to and watch the podcast.

Our philosophy on sponsors is and always has been the following:

We only work with brands whose products we personally use and love.

When we have changed or stopped working with a sponsor, it reflects one or more of the following:

They no longer wished to sponsor the podcast
We found a superior product
We changed our stance on their product based on new information or our experience
They went out of business or merged with a larger group we do not endorse
If we no longer work with a sponsor, we remove those ads from our audio back catalog. Alas, YouTube does not allow for easy removal of segments within video content, but in those cases we remove the links from the video description.

If you come across any mention of Dr. Andrew Huberman or the Huberman Lab podcast in connection with a particular product online, it does not necessarily mean that we endorse it. We caution against the unauthorized use of Dr. Huberman’s image, name, likeness and reputation, and references to the Huberman Lab podcast.

Therefore, we have listed here our current sponsor and partner relationships.

Please note that we may receive a commission or affiliate share from some of these sponsors. However, this isn’t the only way to purchase products from them. We’ve provided our links for your convenience and to support the podcast.

Joe Rogan,Joe Rogan’s Post-Workout Recovery,"Dietary supplements play an important role in Joe Rogan’s pursuit of total human optimization. He’s been taking supplements for most of his adult life to benefit his general health and well-being, to improve athletic performance and recovery as well as to boost cognitive function. Rogan relies on supplements to provide his body with proper amounts of essential nutrients especially those that are deficient or missing in his diet.

We’ve compiled a list of every capsule, tablet, powder and liquid that Joe Rogan supplements with (sources are provided). Taking everything in his supplement stack would likely cost several hundred dollars per month. Fortunately for Rogan, his investment in Onnit not only provides him with a supply of free supplements but also a piece of the multi-billion dollar supplement industry.

In addition, we’ve included the supplements that frequent JRE podcast guest Dr. Rhonda Patrick takes for comparison purposes. She has a PhD in biomedical science and is an expert on nutrition, brain health and aging. Her approach to supplementation is from a science and research-based perspective."
Joe Rogan,Keto Products on the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast,"To supplement his modest income from Spotify, Joe Rogan reads a few sponsored ads that may appear at the beginning of each episode, once or twice during the podcast or not at all.

Listed below are the most recent sponsors that advertise on The Joe Rogan Experience Podcast along with their respective promo codes or offer landing pages. Some of these deals are available for a limited time while others are ongoing."
Joe Rogan,What is Joe Rogan drinking on the JRE Podcast?,"Joe Rogan is more active than ever despite getting older. His current exercise routine includes weightlifting, cardio machines, hill sprints, trail running, hot yoga, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and kickboxing. To prevent his body from breaking down while maintaining the frequency and intensity of these workouts, Rogan employs a number of tools, techniques and treatments for post-workout recovery. He’s always looking for the latest and greatest methods of recovery to relieve nagging aches and pains, reduce inflammation, stiffness and muscle soreness, heal injuries and build muscle.

Rogan currently uses a combination of rest, massage, stretching, hydration, nutrition, inversion therapy, dry sauna, cryotherapy, red light therapy and CBD for his post-workout recovery. It’s no secret that Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT), stem cell treatments and Regenokine also play an important role. In addition, he performs some specific exercises to prevent and rehabilitate injuries."
Joe Rogan,Joe Rogan Experience Podcast Equipment & Studio Setup,"Joe Rogan has been an advocate of the ketogenic diet for a few years now. The ketogenic diet (also known as keto) is a low carbohydrate, high fat diet that puts your body in a metabolic state called ketosis. The liver converts fat into ketones which your body uses for energy instead of glucose from carbs. Many people use a keto diet to lose weight but there are also several health benefits especially for those diagnosed with cancer, diabetes and epilepsy. Joe Rogan says he’s mostly keto although he does cheat on occasion especially when on vacation or for linguine with clams.

Joe Rogan Experience Podcast Episode #994
Dom D’Agostino was a guest on the JRE Podcast #994. Dr. D’Agostino is one of the leading experts on ketosis and the ketogenic diet. He is an Associate Professor (Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology) at the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine in Tampa and a Research Scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC). His research focuses on the effects of nutrition on diseases that impact muscles and movement.



If you’re currently on a ketogenic diet, considering going keto or just wondering what keto is all about, this episode is definitely worth listening to. D’Agostino goes in-depth on the science and research behind the ketogenic diet. He discusses the types of foods he typically eats (roughly the same 12 to 15 foods every week including lots of egg yolk omelets) as well as the keto products he personally uses and recommends to those on a keto diet. People send him a ton of keto products which he personally vets out by testing his blood glucose response and ketone levels. He only likes about 10% of the products sent to him"
Joe Rogan,Books Read by Joe Rogan in 2023,"Joe Rogan is always drinking something weird on the podcast, drinks that the average person hasn’t tried or maybe even heard of. From mushroom coffee to kombucha to Kill Cliff, what is this stuff? If you’re trying to find a drink or brand you heard mentioned on the podcast or just wondering what Joe Rogan’s favorite drinks are, check out the list below. Rogan has gone out of his way to say that he hasn’t been paid to promote these brands, he just really likes them."
Joe Rogan,Books Read by Joe Rogan in 2022,"Ever wonder what microphones or headphones are used by Joe Rogan and his guests on The Joe Rogan Experience Podcast? If you’re curious about what podcasting equipment is used to produce one of the biggest podcasts in the world, we’ve compiled a full list of the audio/video gear.

Not all of this gear is necessary to record your own podcast. The Joe Rogan Experience is just one example out of thousands of podcasts, the vast majority of which are audio only. Every podcaster will have a custom setup to suit their podcast’s format. Cheaper alternatives for each piece of equipment are definitely available."
Joe Rogan,Books Read by Joe Rogan in 2021,"Listed below are books that Joe Rogan is currently reading or has recently finished reading. Listeners of The Joe Rogan Experience are no doubt familiar with these book titles as Rogan has mentioned them frequently on the podcast (some far more than others). He seems to recommend nearly every book he reads or at least offer high praise.


To be more accurate, Rogan prefers listening to books over reading and typically reads only one physical book for every 7 or 8 audiobooks. He says that audiobooks give him something productive to do to fill the “dead time” while he’s driving to and from the podcast studio, comedy club or airport and when he’s in the sauna. Lately Rogan appears to have multiple audiobooks on the go at the same time.

Whenever Joe Rogan mentions a new book that he’s reading or listening to, we’ll add it to the list."

Vincent Rehms,Work & Producvitiy Setup,"I don't spend much money on vanity objects such as clothes. I'd much rather spend, or INVEST, money in things that drive my productivity. I've been a productivity fanatic since university."
Vincent Rehms,Travel Gear,"Since 2018, I've switched homes over 20 times now. You may call me an expert-level digital nomad. As such, packability, efficiency and minimalism are key tenets for my life."
Vincent Rehms,Functional Clothing,"I am a sucker for functional clothing, wearable for any occasion. It's just efficient and reduces the amount of clothes you need."
Vincent Rehms,Tech & Gadgets,Been a techhead my whole life. Love to find good value for money and things that just WORK.
Vincent Rehms,Foodism,"Le favorite snacks and food items, inspired by my childhood."
Vincent Rehms,Daily Stuff,"Just some items for daily life, including hygiene products, home items and general stuff."
Vincent Rehms,Favorite Fiction Books,"Mostly camped in the scifi genre. It's because good scifi incorporates high-philosophy with modern scientific knowledge (which classic philosophy lacks). There is a reason why the most successful visionaries of the world (Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Naval Ravikant, Barack Obama etc.) ALL love scifi.

Good scifi speculates about and in part predicts the future - branded as a ""nerdy"" endeavour by the masses, until the masses find themselves within that very world (computers, then social media, then crypto, AI – in the near future cyborgism, immortality, colonization of space).

The very best scifi also tackles the biggest questions of existence without the mystic shrouding of religion. Concepts such as the many-world theory of quantum physics, the idea of life as an antithesis to entropy or the theme of human transcendence should be, in my mind, essential reading for any smart person.

I'm also very much into fantasy and historical novels. Huge credit go to my brothers, who discover most of the unexpected gems in realm of fiction for me."
Vincent Rehms,Favorite Non-FIction Books,"Bettering oneself has never been easier. Designing a good life and fulfilling your calling requires you to know about your biochemistry, the pitfalls of your limited human mind/body, as well as the pitfalls of an external society that wants to place you in a very cramped box. Furthermore, it requires you to seek out spiritual narratives and mental models that propel you in the right direction.

With non-fiction it's important to filter out the biased, the woo-woo, and the shallow (which is unfortunately the majority of non-fiction). It's why I set up Favolist: so like-minded people can filter more quickly."
Vincent Rehms,Games,Boardgames and video games.
Vincent Rehms,The Games Of My Past,"I grew up in poverty and felt permanently inferior among my rich peers at my scholarship-funded private school. I toned down my nerdiness, to not appear like Hermione and be the subject of peer scrutiny, since at the time intelligent people were immediately lowered in status in the chimp-like hierarchy that's middle school (wish I could have gone to school in Asia instead...). In any case, life was truly shit. Add to the mix a depressed, completely broke Dad brooding and toxifying at home, a burnt-out barely making ends meet mom always out on this job or that, dysfunctional relationship between step parent and step child, witnessing alienation and  blatant racism at school, being a charity-case by donning donated clothes or by moving with that dysfunctional family to the oppulent houses of friends so we're in a nice place at least for the holidays – even though on the outside I was sunshine kid, inside I was just fucking through everything and hated everything.

But I had an escape of this shitty life. Sailing across the world of Zelda: The Windwaker, countering constant gloom with shouts of winning joy in sibling/friend contests on Super Smash Brothers, immersing myself in the intricate and epic story of Metal Gear Solid, or being moved to tears by the music of Kingdom Hearts. I truly don't know what I would have done without games, my escape into worlds that were better.

It reminds me of a story I once read in a forum, a 13-year old who had planned his suicide and was very close to executing around Christmas time, when his mom scratched together enough money for a Playstation and Assasin's Creed: Blackflag. He was moved by it, and decided to delay his end for a bit just to weave some last, small, fond memories for his small brother. So he played, with his brother watching intently in the typical little-brotheresque fashion. They immersed themselves in the world, and it brought them escape from the domestic misery. They bonded with the game and with each other. This kid is now a well-off man who managed to build a content life for himself. A tattoo of the Assassin's Creed logo marks his lower arm, and when people ask him about it he says ""Oh I'm just really an embarrasingly huge fan of the AC series"". Little do they know that this game saved his life.

This list is a tribute to the personally meaningful games of my life."
