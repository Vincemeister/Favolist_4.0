If the powder is not a radiant viper green and doesn't hit you with a strong scent upon opening a can, you've been sold the watered down commercialised outside of Japan. If matcha is not prepared or stored correctly, it oxidizes and loses it's bright green color and natural flavor, getting too bitter instead.
Why should you drink matcha: matcha has the highest concentration of anti-oxidants and L-theanine of all green teas. 

Dr. Andrew Weil, one of the major forces in the scientific research of psychedelics, wanted to bring more high-quality matcha to the West, which is why he set up matcha.com.

https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mnoWx73FL._SL1500_.jpg","Germans are known for being the largest per capita consumer of chocolates and chocolate snacks. WIth that, also comes the best variety of mass chocolate snacks in the world (the US may have the largest variety in general, but they have a huge proportion of truly shitty low-quality snacks, so I put Germany ahead). So it's safe to say as a child I was exposed to quite a lot of chocolate, even though with age my appreciation of chocolate faded away. Little did I know that the best chocolate snack was actually on the other side of the world.

Upon discovering Tim Tams, just recently, I regained that childish appreciation for chocolate.  With remarkable texture, appearance and taste, Tim Tams are an Australian biscuit (American cookie) that you will never forget.

Texture and Appearance:
Tim Tam’s very closely resemble a Twix candy bar. Being about half the length and two to three times the width of a Twix, it has a smooth, milky exterior. The interior of the cookie has a cream, filled center that is sandwiched between two crunchy biscuits. Tim Tam’s have 10-20 cookies in each package, depending on whether you buy the regular or value pack boxes. Finally, in Australia each package is sold for no more than $2.50; but if bought online from the U.S. they can be as much as $7.00 a box.

Taste:
Tim Tams are offered in a variety of flavors ranging from chocolate, to salted caramel, to red velvet. One of the most popular flavors on the market would be the double coat flavor. Offering twice the amount of chocolate on its exterior as the regular chocolate Tim Tams, it leaves an impression on your taste buds that will leave you begging for more. These cookies are known for causing binge eating; meaning the cookies are so tasty, that people often finish the whole package in one sitting.

Availability:
The only downside to Tim Tams is they're hard to find outside of Australia. The off-brand American Tim Tams can be found at your local Target, but they just don't have quite the same effect as the Australian version. Otherwise, your only other options are to buy it online or find a “world food store” that might possibly have them in stock; which can cause them to be expensive due to shipping and rarity costs.

I truly think Tim Tams are the best cookies you can buy. Even though they can be hard to find, I would recommend them to everyone. With a taste and texture that puts it above all other cookies, it’s no surprise they have taken Australia by storm.",,

Players use human armies and diplomacy, progress through development ages, enhance military and economic performance with improvements, and manage economics through resource gathering and trade. Mythology enters the mix when players call upon the gods to act on their behalf or reinforce their armies with more than 20 mythological creatures such as jackal-headed Egyptian warriors or mighty minotaurs.

Amazing special effects change the look of this beautiful world when the gods get involved: all grows dark as an eclipse takes effect, funnel clouds twist and grow as a tornado sends buildings spinning toward the heavens, and meteors streak in from the heavens to send people and armies flying. An entertaining tutorial, an intuitive interface, and logical game rules allow anyone to quickly and easily learn to play. Once started, there is a lot to explore: an epic 36 scenario single player campaign, easy-to-use multiplayer gaming online, single player games against the challenging Age of Mythology AI opponents, more than 15 different random map types that help make the game infinitely replayable, nine highly differentiated civilizations, multiple difficulty levels to allow players of any skill level to have an enjoyable game, and a fully functional scenario editor.

The catch is that the ""Neanderthal Poets"" are only allowed to use single syllable words. If they use any words with more than one syllable, the other team gets to bop them with a 2-foot inflatable club. The team with the most points wins!

• MAKE PARTY GREAT: We have fun game. Help team guess word on card. Catch is, use only one sound. No big words or boom stick hit you! Poetry for Neanderthals is the guessing game that needs you to channel your inner caveman. Speak in single syllables and win points with every correct guess. If you start talking fancy, someone from the opposing team gets to bop you with an inflatable club. Looking for a party game for kids and adults that will have the crowd roaring with laughter? You’ve found it!
• COMPLETE GAME SET: You’ll have everything you need. Just call your crew, tell them to leave their grammar at the door, and let the games begin. You’ll receive 200 double-sided cards, 2 game boards, and a 2-foot inflatable No! Stick, and 1 sand timer. And we know you’ll get a bit too enthusiastic with the inflated club- it’s hard not to. That’s why we’ve thrown in a repair patch with each of the card games for families. In case anything happens, just patch it up, and keep on guessing.
• WHOLE FAMILY FUN: Kids will love it. Teens won’t get enough of it. Adults will be scrambling to get their own copy. Meet your new game night staple. Poetry for Neanderthals is great for grownups & kids ages 7+ and accommodates 2-6 players. The more of your primitive family and friends you bring in on the fun, the more knee-slapping hilarity will ensue. Break it out after dinner, on lazy weekends, during picnics, or at work when your boss has gone for that conference.
• ELEVATE THE EXCITEMENT: It make fun big plus big. Laugh loud plus loud. Pal will greet hand. Tell you praise. Say top day of life …. We’re talking about the Poetry for Neanderthals expansion pack! (And we know we’d get bopped a few times there. We live dangerously) The More Cards Box 1 adds 2,000 new words and phrases. Think you can do better than our Neanderthal brains?

It all started on a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park. While four senior outdoor enthusiasts get together，the conversation took an unexpected turn to the subject of outdoor gears. Our designer friend brought an awesome travel backpack. We agreed that it was very beautiful and functional, but cost a lot. A question came to our minds: Why don't we make some practical, stylish and lightweight outdoor gear? After camping, our trip leads us to Big Sky City in Montana. Lying under the starry sky, we decided to build a functional and stylish outdoor brand.   We started with quick-drying towels and backpacks. In this year, we did various design draft and material testings. After many twist and turns, we finally resolve the basic prototypes of our original towels and backpacks. We received a lot of valuable messages from many outdoor enthusiasts which we would like to thank to.   4Monster was born, based on technical materials, and with the latest design, we are committed to creating a ""portable"" outdoor products brand, with minimizing size, but also aesthetic, durable, practical and fashion. 4Monster Co-funder& General Manager --------Gary & Eddy Prefect for Outdoor We really hope our customer will feel special when they carry this towel to the outdoor.So we designed a new portable case rather than a small bag. This is the third towel we designed. The first one we focus on is portable and soft. The second towel is highly absorbent and ideal for water sports. The third is a combination of the previous two models. It is soft, light and easy to carry, and also absorbs water very well. If you are not sure what you will encounter on the trip, this towel will be your first choice. 85% polyester & 15% polyamide material，the perfect combination of softness, lightness and strong water absorption. As a microfiber towel manufacturer with over 30 years history , we only bring quality product to our customer:   WASH TIPS: machion washable in cold/gentle water do not bleach do not dry clean do not iron do not tumble dry You can safely bring the 4Monster travel towel to the beach,just shake the towel, the sand will fall off Treated with SILVADUR technology.It will continue to release silver ions in the fabric . This is completely harmless to the body. We were inspired by silver tableware, which proved to be very successful. You will find a free carabiner in the package . Made of metal, it is stronger and more durable, with this you can easily hang our towel on your backpack or belt. PS：Do not use this carabiner for professional mountaineering. 4Monster microfiber camping towel can be easily put in a pocket without any extra weight. It is also an excellent space saver in a backpack or suitcase. No longer necessary to carry large and heavy towels when traveling and exercising outdoors！ Sand Free No Smell Additional Free Carabiner Portable & Light Weight 6 sizes & 12 colors,we got all your activities covered Latest EVA case rather than mesh bag,portable and keep towels clean during the trip Easily fit in a pocket or hang on a backpack 85% polyester & 15% polyamide material,perfect combination of water absorption and softness.Towels for any situation

The Three-Body Problem is the first chance for English-speaking readers to experience the Hugo Award-winning phenomenon from China's most beloved science fiction author, Liu Cixin.

An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth.

It's the most epic (as in grand scale epic), mindbending and imaginative story ever written, especially the climactic third book. The triology has been hailed by the world's most influential people like Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Barack Obama, Mark Zuckerberg and Neil Gaiman.

Rememberance of Earth's Past dives extremely deep into humanity's and the universe's most crucial questions. And, for those fundamental questions, hard science is essential. This is why I believe powerful science fiction is just as important and relevant as classic philosophy in the discussion of these questions. Aristotle, Confucius, Nietzsche or the Buddha simply didn't possess scientific knowledge and understanding of the universe we have today. And philsophy without the intersection of science, in my mind, only paints half the picture.

It's futurism at it's finest, and I strongly believe many elements of this book are of predictive nature – just as Neal Stephenson predicted crypto, surveillance and the metaverse.

Seriously – I'm mad how averse the average person is to science-fiction. There's so much to be taught in good scifi. I place this on the same pedestal as anything from the likes of Dostoevski, Tom Sawyer or Shakespeare. Actually, I personally find the thought patterns and ideas discussed in these books more important than in any of the other literature just mentioned. Because it's about the fundamentals of the universe and very existence. Not so much intellectual abstractions or mere human nature. This is so much fucking deeper.",,

It could serve as a TEXTBOOK FOR HISTORY even though it's ABOUT THE FUTURE.

An orphan’s life is harsh - and often short - in the mysterious island city of Camorr. But young Locke Lamora dodges death and slavery, becoming a thief under the tutelage of a gifted con artist. As leader of the band of light-fingered brothers known as the Gentleman Bastards, Locke is soon infamous, fooling even the underworld’s most feared ruler.

Faced with a bloody coup that threatens to destroy everyone and everything that holds meaning in his mercenary life, Locke vows to beat the enemy at his own brutal game - or die trying.

One of them, the Prussian aristocrat Alexander von Humboldt, negotiates savannas and jungle, travels down the Orinoco River, tastes poisons, climbs the highest mountain known to man, counts head lice, and explores every hole in the ground. The other, the barely socialized mathematician and astronomer Carl Friedrich Gauss, does not even need to leave his home in Göttingen to prove that space is curved. He can run prime numbers in his head. He cannot imagine a life without women, yet he jumps out of bed on his wedding night to jot down a mathematical formula.

Von Humboldt is known to history as the Second Columbus. Gauss is recognized as the greatest mathematical brain since Newton. Terrifyingly famous and more than eccentric in their old age, the two meet in Berlin in 1828.

The Kindly Ones is unmistakably the work of a profoundly gifted writer.” — Time

A literary prize-winner that has been an explosive bestseller all over the world, Jonathan Littell’s The Kindly Ones has been called “a brilliant Holocaust novel. . . a world-class masterpiece of astonishing brutality, originality, and force,” (Michael Korda, The Daily Beast). Destined to join the pantheon of classic epics of war such as Tolstoy’s War and Peace and Vasily Grossman’s Life and Fate, The Kindly Ones offers a profound and gripping experience of the horrors of World War II and the Holocaust.

A former Nazi officer, Dr. Maximilien Aue has reinvented himself, many years after the war, as a middle-class family man and factory owner in France. An intellectual steeped in philosophy, literature, and classical music, he is also a cold-blooded assassin and the consummate bureaucrat. Through the eyes of this cultivated yet monstrous man we experience in disturbingly precise detail the horrors of the Second World War and the Nazi genocide of the Jews. Eichmann, Himmler, Göring, Speer, Heydrich, Höss—even Hitler himself—play a role in Max's story. An intense and hallucinatory historical epic, The Kindly Ones is also a morally challenging read.

“Vinge is one of the best visionary writers of SF today.”-David Brin

Thousands of years in the future, humanity is no longer alone in a universe where a mind's potential is determined by its location in space, from superintelligent entities in the Transcend, to the limited minds of the Unthinking Depths, where only simple creatures, and technology, can function. Nobody knows what strange force partitioned space into these ""regions of thought,"" but when the warring Straumli realm use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon, they unwittingly unleash an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and enslaves all natural and artificial intelligence.

Fleeing this galactic threat, Ravna crash lands on a strange world with a ship-hold full of cryogenically frozen children, the only survivors from a destroyed space-lab.

For all her reign the Red Queen has fought the long war, contested in secret, against the powers that stand behind nations, for higher stakes than land or gold. Her greatest weapon is The Silent Sister—unseen by most and unspoken of by all.

The Red Queen’s grandson, Prince Jalan Kendeth—drinker, gambler, seducer of women—is one who can see The Silent Sister. Content with his role as a minor royal, Jal pretends that the hideous crone is not there. But war with the undead is coming, and the Red Queen has called on her family to defend the realm. Jal thinks that nothing that will affect him. He's wrong...

After escaping a death trap set by the Silent Sister, Jal finds his fate magically intertwined with a fierce Norse warrior. As the two undertake a journey to undo the spell, encountering grave dangers, willing women, and an upstart prince named Jorg Ancrath along the way, Jalan gradually catches a glimmer of the truth: he and the Norseman are but pieces in a game—and the Red Queen controls the board.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ckSutXcHL._CLa%7C2570,2260%7C91Av-r9E5AL.jpg,91lGqfIEvQL.jpg%7C0,0,1168,2260+1402,0,1168,2260+584,0,1402,2260_._SY300_.jpg","From the same author as my second favorite book series, The Broken Empire, and set in the same world and around the same time.

'Deep work' is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. Coined by author and professor Cal Newport on his popular blog Study Hacks, deep work will make you better at what you do, let you achieve more in less time and provide the sense of true fulfilment that comes from the mastery of a skill. In short, deep work is like a superpower in our increasingly competitive economy.

And yet most people, whether knowledge workers in noisy open-plan offices or creatives struggling to sharpen their vision, have lost the ability to go deep - spending their days instead in a frantic blur of email and social media, not even realising there's a better way.

A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, DEEP WORK takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories -- from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air -- and surprising suggestions, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored.

Put simply: developing and cultivating a deep work practice is one of the best decisions you can make in an increasingly distracted world and this book will point the way.

From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.”

One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?

Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.

Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough, yet riveting—famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda.

What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus.

Kahneman's work with Amos Tversky is the subject of Michael Lewis's The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds

In his mega bestseller, Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman, the renowned psychologist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think.

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions.

Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Winner of the National Academy of Sciences Best Book Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and selected by The New York Times Book Review as one of the ten best books of 2011, Thinking, Fast and Slow is destined to be a classic.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41shZGS-G+L.jpg,"We like to think ourselves rational creatures, far removed from the impulsiveness of animals.

Between 1942 and 1945 Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory-known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos (""meaning"")-holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.

Frankl was able to convert the abject misery of concetration camp life into a purpose of surviving, and then went on to derive another meaning when getting out. Of ensuring humanity moves forward so things like Nazi Germany do not happen again, by helping people find their purpose and making sure they find good purposes.

In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be ""positive"" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.

For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. ""F**k positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.

Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.

There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mN3bY0JjL.jpg,"Possibly the best non-fiction book title ever conceived. And it also happens to be a great book. Mark Manson is a great yet accessible writer.

Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck is not about being indifferent. It just means you’re comfortable with being different. Don’t say fuck it to everything in life, just to the unimportant things.
Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first care about something more important than adversity.
Subtlety #3: Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about. The key is to gradually prune the things you care about, so that you only give a fuck on the most important of occasions.",,

We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.

What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.

Now, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.

With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul.

Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now.

People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.

He calls them atomic habits.

In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.

These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life.

I thought very, very carefully before adding this book to the list for the simple reason of shame. Then I realised: why the fuck should I be ashamed? Because of the stigma? Fair enough. Virtually every book about this topic is filled with sexism, sleezy tactics and ascribes puffing yourself to be something you're not. The only relevant elements they convey are of evolutionary biology and aspects of hypergamy. Models is different. Whilst the function expliclity says how to attract women, it teaches you how to just be a better man.

In high school, I was a vigin, mainly by merit of feeling inferior of being the poor kid that wore donated clothes, in a school full of rich kids, plus being slightly outcasted for being the straightest A student. I turned that around in university. I became a fuckboy. It took me a long time to realize that just fucking around and being a player was a facade constructed by my inferiority complex as a result of some truly shitty teenage years – a redemption. It wasn't until I read this book in my twenties that I changed.

I realized I was hyper-anxious because of childhood trauma, that I was raised in a dysfunctional family plagued by repressed and unrepressed rage, and that my father was a brooding, depressed and broke person that couldn't teach me the basic values of being a good man. Models did a good job in turning that around. I faced the insecurities, and stopped dating for the sake of dating, and started dating for the sake of connecting with the opposite gender in a healthy way. I learned about working on myself in terms of style and honing in the importance of aesthetics which is something women do on a much greater scale and which merits our reciprocal effort, I learned the distinction between honest self-confidence as opposed to fake confidence and, most of all, I learned to be authentic and accept myself (including all the baggage from the past) and value myself and share myself with partners and potential partners.

I'm proud of who I am today, dated great women as a result of this book (and not just sexy women), and for the first time was able to hold longer-term relationships not marred by toxicity.

His restless life was packed with adventure and discovery, whether climbing the highest volcanoes in the world or racing through anthrax-infested Siberia.

Wulf examines how his writings inspired other naturalists and poets such as Wordsworth, Darwin, and Goethe, and she makes the compelling case that it was Humboldt's influence on John Muir that led him to his ideas of preservation and that shaped Thoreau's Walden.

If you cannot ease into a social night out with strangers without some drinks, if you committed yourself to ""just one beer"" and end up going on an absolute bender more than five times in a year, then you've got a problem too. Alcohol is just so omnipresent that it's not perceived like a problem, and only when you crave it on a daily basis is it supposed to be dangerous. Thing is, alchohol is a genuine poison that damages the body in such profound ways that one binge session can have long-lasting consequences. This is not something taught in school, for the teachers and writers of textbooks have their fair share of binges of life. So do your parents and friends and almost everyone. It's the one thing all major religions overlap in: don't drink alcohol. Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism: all warn of alcohol. Yet it's the most widely ignored tenet of all believers.

Obviously I'm not a guy of extremes to say never drink or ever get drunk (although. that's very sound advice too), but the permeance of alcohol into the fabric of our every day life is ludcrious. I've no doubt that in some decades people will look back at our generations and be gobsmacked at how we all drank, just as we now look back on smoking.

This Naked Mind provides some truly fascinating insights into how fucked alcohol is.",,
Vini's Non-Fiction Goodies,,Alcohol Explained,https://www.amazon.com/Alcohol-Explained-William-Porter-ebook/dp/B00W4D1YW4/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2GEF1TBO4PTDW&keywords=alcohol+explained&qid=1693324641&s=digital-text&sprefix=alcohol+explai%2Cdigital-text%2C407&sr=1-1,6.99,"Alcohol Explained is the definitive, ground-breaking guide to alcohol and alcoholism. It explains how alcohol affects human beings on a chemical, physiological and psychological level, from those first drinks right up to chronic alcoholism. Alcoholism and problem drinking seems illogical to those on the outside, indeed it is equally perplexing for the alcoholic or problem drinker. This book provides a logical, easy to follow explanation of the phenomenon and detailed instructions on how to beat it. Despite being entirely scientific and factual in nature the book is presented in an accessible and easily understandable format.

""This is an excellent book written by an inquisitive and educated author who during a period of his life suffered from alcoholism. The book explains in an easily understood language the various effects that alcohol has on our body. In my opinion the text would serve as a great handbook not only for those struggling with alcohol but also medical students as part of their education. I am sure some of my own patients troubled with alcoholism in recent years could have benefitted from reading William’s book and I will be recommending it going forward.""",https://res.cloudinary.com/dncij7vr6/image/upload/v1686825737/Favolist%204.0/app%20assets/amazon-logo-transparent_lhlhxu.png,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41cJSuXAY-L.jpg,"In comparison to this This Naked Mind, Alcohol Explained dives more into the biochemical angle of drinkiing. Enlightening and shocking.",,
