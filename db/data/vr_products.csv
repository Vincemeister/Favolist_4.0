If the powder is not a radiant viper green and already smells upon opening a can, you've been sold the watered down commercialised version in the west. Or rather, outside of Japan. If matcha is not prepared or stored correctly, it oxidizes and loses it's bright green color and natural flavor, getting too bitter instead.
Why should you drink matcha: matcha has the highest concentration of anti-oxidants and L-theanine of all green teas. 

Dr. Andrew Weil, one of the major forces in the scientific research of psychedelics, wanted to bring more high-quality matcha to the West, which is why he set up matcha.com.

https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mnoWx73FL._SL1500_.jpg","Germans are known for being the largest per capita consumer of chocolates and chocolate snacks. WIth that, also comes the best variety of mass chocolate snacks in the world (the US may have the largest variety in general, but they have a huge proportion of truly shitty low-quality snacks, so I put Germany ahead). So it's safe to say as a child I was exposed to quite a lot of chocolate, even though with age my immediate desire and happiness for chocolate faded away. Little did I know that the best chocolate snack was actually on the other side of the world.

Upon discovering Tim Tams, just recently, I regained that childish appreciation for chocolate.  With remarkable; texture; appearance; and taste, Tim Tams are an Australian biscuit (American cookie) that you will never forget.

Texture and Appearance:
Tim Tam’s very closely resemble a Twix candy bar. Being about half the length and two to three times the width of a Twix, it has a smooth, milky exterior. The interior of the cookie has a cream, filled center that is sandwiched between two crunchy biscuits. Tim Tam’s have 10-20 cookies in each package, depending on whether you buy the regular or value pack boxes. Finally, in Australia each package is sold for no more than $2.50; but if bought online from the U.S. they can be as much as $7.00 a box.

Taste:
Tim Tams are offered in a variety of flavors ranging from chocolate, to salted caramel, to red velvet. One of the most popular flavors on the market would be the double coat flavor. Offering twice the amount of chocolate on its exterior as the regular chocolate Tim Tams, it leaves an impression on your taste buds that will leave you begging for more. These cookies are known for causing binge eating; meaning the cookies are so tasty, that people often finish the whole package in one sitting.

Availability:
The only downside to Tim Tams is they're hard to find outside of Australia. The off-brand American Tim Tams can be found at your local Target, but they just don't have quite the same effect as the Australian version. Otherwise, your only other options are to buy it online or find a “world food store” that might possibly have them in stock; which can cause them to be expensive due to shipping and rarity costs.

I truly think Tim Tams are the best cookies you can buy. Even though they can be hard to find, I would recommend them to everyone. With a taste and texture that puts it above all other cookies, it’s no surprise they have taken Australia by storm.",,

The catch is that the ""Neanderthal Poets"" are only allowed to use single syllable words. If they use any words with more than one syllable, the other team gets to bop them with a 2-foot inflatable club. The team with the most points wins!

• MAKE PARTY GREAT: We have fun game. Help team guess word on card. Catch is, use only one sound. No big words or boom stick hit you! Poetry for Neanderthals is the guessing game that needs you to channel your inner caveman. Speak in single syllables and win points with every correct guess. If you start talking fancy, someone from the opposing team gets to bop you with an inflatable club. Looking for a party game for kids and adults that will have the crowd roaring with laughter? You’ve found it!
• COMPLETE GAME SET: You’ll have everything you need. Just call your crew, tell them to leave their grammar at the door, and let the games begin. You’ll receive 200 double-sided cards, 2 game boards, and a 2-foot inflatable No! Stick, and 1 sand timer. And we know you’ll get a bit too enthusiastic with the inflated club- it’s hard not to. That’s why we’ve thrown in a repair patch with each of the card games for families. In case anything happens, just patch it up, and keep on guessing.
• WHOLE FAMILY FUN: Kids will love it. Teens won’t get enough of it. Adults will be scrambling to get their own copy. Meet your new game night staple. Poetry for Neanderthals is great for grownups & kids ages 7+ and accommodates 2-6 players. The more of your primitive family and friends you bring in on the fun, the more knee-slapping hilarity will ensue. Break it out after dinner, on lazy weekends, during picnics, or at work when your boss has gone for that conference.
• ELEVATE THE EXCITEMENT: It make fun big plus big. Laugh loud plus loud. Pal will greet hand. Tell you praise. Say top day of life …. We’re talking about the Poetry for Neanderthals expansion pack! (And we know we’d get bopped a few times there. We live dangerously) The More Cards Box 1 adds 2,000 new words and phrases. Think you can do better than our Neanderthal brains? We’ve also included 20 blank cards that give you the power to personalize the game.
• WELCOME TO THE FAMILY: Poetry for Neanderthals is created by the same guys that gave you Exploding Kittens - an idea first launched on Kickstarter. We aimed to raise $10K. We ended up with $8.7M in 30 days from 219,000 backers. Close to a decade later, Exploding Kittens is still the #1 most-backed project in Kickstarter history.

It all started on a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park. While four senior outdoor enthusiasts get together，the conversation took an unexpected turn to the subject of outdoor gears. Our designer friend brought an awesome travel backpack. We agreed that it was very beautiful and functional, but cost a lot. A question came to our minds: Why don't we make some practical, stylish and lightweight outdoor gear? After camping, our trip leads us to Big Sky City in Montana. Lying under the starry sky, we decided to build a functional and stylish outdoor brand.   We started with quick-drying towels and backpacks. In this year, we did various design draft and material testings. After many twist and turns, we finally resolve the basic prototypes of our original towels and backpacks. We received a lot of valuable messages from many outdoor enthusiasts which we would like to thank to.   4Monster was born, based on technical materials, and with the latest design, we are committed to creating a ""portable"" outdoor products brand, with minimizing size, but also aesthetic, durable, practical and fashion. 4Monster Co-funder& General Manager --------Gary & Eddy Prefect for Outdoor We really hope our customer will feel special when they carry this towel to the outdoor.So we designed a new portable case rather than a small bag. This is the third towel we designed. The first one we focus on is portable and soft. The second towel is highly absorbent and ideal for water sports. The third is a combination of the previous two models. It is soft, light and easy to carry, and also absorbs water very well. If you are not sure what you will encounter on the trip, this towel will be your first choice. 85% polyester & 15% polyamide material，the perfect combination of softness, lightness and strong water absorption. As a microfiber towel manufacturer with over 30 years history , we only bring quality product to our customer:   WASH TIPS: machion washable in cold/gentle water do not bleach do not dry clean do not iron do not tumble dry You can safely bring the 4Monster travel towel to the beach,just shake the towel, the sand will fall off Treated with SILVADUR technology.It will continue to release silver ions in the fabric . This is completely harmless to the body. We were inspired by silver tableware, which proved to be very successful. You will find a free carabiner in the package . Made of metal, it is stronger and more durable, with this you can easily hang our towel on your backpack or belt. PS：Do not use this carabiner for professional mountaineering. 4Monster microfiber camping towel can be easily put in a pocket without any extra weight. It is also an excellent space saver in a backpack or suitcase. No longer necessary to carry large and heavy towels when traveling and exercising outdoors！ Sand Free No Smell Additional Free Carabiner Portable & Light Weight 6 sizes & 12 colors,we got all your activities covered Latest EVA case rather than mesh bag,portable and keep towels clean during the trip Easily fit in a pocket or hang on a backpack 85% polyester & 15% polyamide material,perfect combination of water absorption and softness.Towels for any situation
